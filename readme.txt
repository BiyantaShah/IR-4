-> Compile/Run:
        1. For task-1, all the deliverable are in folder "./Task-1".
             - To generate 9 tables (one per query) each containing at MOST 100
                docIDs ranked by score, please run "./src/HW4.java"
                and it will write 9 files per query in folder "/Task-1/"

             - By default code in HW4.java will try to read corpus data from "./Corpus",
               can manually update the path if want to read different corpus.

             - By default code in HW4.java will create index files generated by Lucene
               in "./Index" folder, can manually update the path if want to write index
               files to different folder.

             - By default code in MySimpleIndexer.java will try to read all queries
               from "./QueryList.txt".

        2. For task-2, all the deliverable are in folder "./Task-2".
             - To generate 9 tables (one per query) each containing at MOST 100
               docIDs ranked by score, please run "./src/MySimpleIndexer.java"
               and it will write 9 files per query in folder "/Task-2/"

             - By default code in MySimpleIndexer.java will try to read one gram indexer data
               from "./One_Gram_Indexer.txt".

             - By default code in MySimpleIndexer.java will try to read each document's length
               data from "./DocumentsLength.txt".

             - By default code in MySimpleIndexer.java will try to read all queries
              from "./QueryList.txt".

        Have used docId mapping to decrease the size of result files. Please use "DocId-Mapping.txt"
        if want to see file name.

        - "Task-2_Explanation.txt" file contains the implementation details for task2

        - "Analyzer_Result_Comparision.txt" file contains the discussion on Top 5 results from each
           IR system for each query.
