Coriolis frequency The Coriolis frequency also called the Coriolis parameter or Coriolis coefficient 1 is equal to twice the rotation rate of the Earth multiplied by the sine of the latitude The rotation rate of the Earth 7.2921 10 5 rad s can be calculated as 2 T radians per second where T is the rotation period of the Earth which is one sidereal day 23 hr 56 m 4.1 s In the midlatitudes the typical value for 4 rad s Inertial oscillations on the surface of the earth have this frequency These oscillations are the result of the Coriolis effect Consider a body for example a fixed volume of atmosphere at latitude meridional direction The Coriolis force proportional to longitudes or in the meridional directions Suppose the body is moving with a velocity where Thus the Coriolis parameter Rossby number In stability calculations the rate of change of Rossby parameter and is usually denoted where Rossby waves See also edit Beta plane Earth s rotation Rossby-gravity waves edit
