to author John Storey there are six definitions of popular culture 18 The quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much high culture eg television dramatizations of Jane Austen is also popular Pop culture is also defined as the culture that is left over when we have decided what high culture is However many works straddle the boundaries eg William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens A third definition equates pop culture with mass culture and ideas This is seen as a commercial culture mass-produced for mass consumption by mass media 19 From a Western European perspective this may be compared to American culture clarification needed Alternatively pop culture can be defined as an authentic culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the

groups in society and the forces of incorporation operating in the interests of dominant groups in society A postmodernist approach to popular culture would no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture Storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the Industrial Revolution Studies of Shakespeare by Weimann Barber or Bristol for example locate much of

spectrum of the public Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the German researcher Ronald Daus who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in North America Asia and especially in Latin America Folklore edit Adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture 22 This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media eg in the form of jokes or urban legend With the widespread use of the Internet from the 1990s the distinction between mass media and word-of-mouth has become blurred Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subculture item sold Moreover beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by word-of-mouth and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolves Entertainment edit Television programs edit Main article Television program A television program is a segment of content intended for
