dubious election supervised by the occupying Union Army Virginia tried to nullify this after the American Civil War but the counties remained part of West Virginia The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was brought before the Supreme Court of the United States in the following manner Berkeley and Jefferson County West Virginia counties lying on the Potomac east of the mountains in 1863 with the consent of the Reorganized Government of Virginia had supposedly voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia However many voters were absent in the

edit Jefferson County has been a Republican-leaning county in the 21st century though likely due to its status as an exurban county of Washington DC since 2008 it has rivaled the university county of Monongalia as the most Democratic part of the state For much of the 20th century the county trended strongly Democratic due to historical sympathies for Confederate Virginia In contrast to its rock-ribbed Unionist and Republican Eastern Panhandle sister Morgan County Jefferson did not vote Republican until Dwight D Eisenhower won by twenty-seven votes in 1956 and afterwards voted republican
