American Meteorological Society The American Meteorological Society AMS is the premier scientific and professional organization in the United States promoting and disseminating information about the atmospheric oceanic and hydrologic sciences Its mission is to advance the atmospheric and related sciences technologies applications and services for the benefit of society 1 Background edit Founded in 1919 by Charles Franklin Brooks the American Meteorological Society has a membership of more than 13,000 weather water and climate scientists professionals researchers educators students and enthusiasts citation needed AMS offers numerous programs and services in the sphere of water weather and climate sciences It publishes eleven atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic journals in print and online sponsors as many as twelve conferences annually and administers professional certification programs and awards The AMS Policy and Education programs promote scientific knowledge and work to increase public understanding of science There is also an extensive network of local and student AMS chapters citation needed AMS headquarters is located at 45 Beacon Street adjacent to the Boston Common in Boston Massachusetts The headquarters building was designed by Charles Bulfinch as the third Harrison Gray Otis House in 1806 and was purchased and renovated by AMS in 1958 with staff moving into the building in 1960 In 2012 AMS purchased the building next door at 44 Beacon Street also designed by Bulfinch AMS also maintains an office in Washington DC at 1200 New York Avenue NW inside the AAAS headquarters 2 Certification programs edit AMS maintains professional certification programs the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist CBM sets a professional standard in broadcast meteorology and the Certified Consulting Meteorologist CCM establishes high standards of technical competence character and experience for consultants who provide advice in meteorology to the public The AMS Seal of Approval was launched in 1957 to recognize on-air meteorologists for their sound delivery of weather information to the general public Many seal holders are still active though the original Seal was succeeded by the CBM Those looking for an expert can consult the listings of all AMS Certified individuals 3 Awards edit AMS recognizes excellent work with over 30 different awards ranging from outstanding research contributions in specific fields to awards for excellence in teaching or broadcasting outstanding books exceptional service in forecasting and more including its highest honor the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Medal 4 AMS also awards more than 100,000 annually in undergraduate and graduate level scholarships and fellowships Publications edit AMS publishes eleven peer reviewed scientific journals as well as books and monographs accounting for more than 34,000 pages each year AMS journals are consistently ranked at or near the top of their fields for impact factor Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society BAMS Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences JAS Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology JAMC Journal of Physical Oceanography JPO Monthly Weather Review MWR Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology JTECH Weather and Forecasting WAF Journal of Climate JCLI Journal of Hydrometeorology JHM Weather Climate and Society WCAS Earth Interactions EI co-published with AGU AAG Meteorological Monographs In addition AMS publishes the Glossary of Meteorology 5 a blog and the scientific database Meteorological and Geoastrophysical Abstracts AMS is a member of Crossref Portico CHORUS and CLOCKSS Policy Program edit The AMS claims their Policy Program works to increase public understanding of the role of scientific information in societal advancement and helps policy-makers ground their decisions in the best available scientific knowledge It carries out research holds periodic briefings that allow experts to inform policy makers directly on established scientific understanding and the latest policy-relevant research and hosts an annual Summer Policy Colloquium to introduce Earth scientists to the federal policy process The Congressional Science Fellowship places an AMS scientist on the staff of a member of Congress for one full year Statements edit AMS issues and periodically updates four different types of statements on topics that fall within the scope of AMS expertise Information statements aim to provide a trustworthy objective and scientifically up-to-date explanation of scientific issues of concern to the public at large They deal with subjects such as climate change and drought Policy statements are aimed at officials of government or international bodies and may articulate the state of scientific understanding raise awareness of a scientific issue or make policy recommendations based on the professional and scientific expertise and perspectives of the AMS examples Weather Water and Climate Priorities Geoengineering the Climate System Space Weather Professional guidance statements alert AMS members to urgent or important AMS professional or scientific matters examples Strengthening Social Sciences in the Weather Climate Enterprise Green Meetings Best Practice statements inform AMS members and the public about AMS endorsed best practices across the weather water and climate enterprise and promote scientifically-based standards and practices example Best Practices for Publicly Sharing Weather Information Via Social Media Meetings and events edit AMS organizes a large number national and international meetings specialized conferences and workshops Annually more than 6,000 people attend AMS meetings covering science technology and applications in the atmospheric and related oceanographic and hydrologic sciences In addition to the AMS Annual Meeting the 97th of which was held in Seattle in 2017 a number of specialty meetings are held each year AMS records oral presentations given at its meetings and posts them online for anyone to view free of charge Over thirty conferences and symposia are held concurrently during the AMS Annual Meeting during which more than 2000 Oral Presentations are given and more than 1000 Posters are presented The AMS Annual Meeting also features an exhibits program where companies and organizations participate Education Program edit The AMS Education Program offers training workshops and undergraduate course curriculum to educate the next generation and increase scientific literacy It claims to have trained over 100,000 teachers AMS partners with NOAA NASA the NSF and the US Navy to offer a suite of teacher professional development programs including three DataStreme courses Project ATMOSPHERE and the Maury Project Textbooks and Investigations Manuals used in AMS DataStreme and Undergraduate Courses are dynamic eBooks with web-based features Many AMS members contribute to the creation and editing of course materials Membership edit The American Meteorological Society has more than 13,000 individual members in nearly 100 countries Membership was initially limited to professionals or scholars in the atmospheric or related sciences but today an array of membership categories accommodate a wide range of people including students teachers corporations and weather enthusiasts Past presidents edit The
