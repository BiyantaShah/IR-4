Etymology edit An expedition led by the French explorer Ren Robert Cavelier Sieur de La Salle named the namesake lake as Lac Sainte-Claire because the Roman Catholic men entered the lake on August 12 1679 the feast day of Sainte Clare of Assisi 1 5 English maps identified the lake feature on maps as early as 1710 as Saint Clare By the Mitchell Map of 1755 the spelling was given as St Clair which is the current version 6 Located along the western shores of Lake Saint Clair and the St Clair River the county was named for them The name is sometimes attributed to honoring Arthur St Clair an American Revolutionary War General and Governor of the Northwest Territory but it was established with the current spelling long before St Clair was considered a notable figure 7 The earlier spelling of the lake s name may have been conflated with that of the general as several political jurisdictions near the lake and the river such as St Clair County St Clair Township and the cities of St Clair and St Clair Shores share this spelling See also List of Michigan county name etymologies The name has sometimes been attributed to honoring Patrick Sinclair a British officer who purchased land on
