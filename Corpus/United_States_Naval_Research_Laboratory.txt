accomplishments edit This building on NRL s main campus features prominent radomes on its roof Space sciences edit The Naval Research Laboratory has a long and ongoing history of major contributions to spacecraft development It placed the second fifth and seventh American satellites in Earth orbit including the first solar-powered satellite the first surveillance satellite the first meteorological satellite and the first GPS satellite Project Vanguard the first American satellite program tasked NRL with the design construction and launch of an artificial satellite which was accomplished in 1958 As of 2013 Vanguard I is still in orbit making it the longest-lived man-made satellite Vanguard II was the first satellite to observe the Earth s cloud cover and therefore the first meteorological satellite NRL s recently declassified Galactic Radiation and Background I GRAB I was the first US intelligence satellite mapping out Soviet radar networks from space The Global Positioning System GPS was invented at NRL and tested by NRL s Timation series of satellites The first operational GPS satellite Timation IV NTS-II was designed and constructed at NRL 8 NRL pioneered the study of the sun Ultraviolet and X-Ray spectrum and continues to contribute to the field with satellites like Coriolis satellite launched in 2003 NRL is also responsible for the Tactical Satellite Program with spacecraft launched in 2006 2009 and 2011 Along with Project Vanguard NRL also designed the first satellite tracking system Minitrack which became the prototype for future satellite tracking networks Prior to the success of surveillance satellites the iconic parabolic antenna atop NRL s main headquarters in Washington DC was part of Communication Moon Relay a project that succeeded in sending and receiving signals bounced off the Moon both for long-distance communications research and surveillance of internal soviet transmissions during the Cold War Meteorology edit NRL satellite image of hurricane Harvey just prior to landfall on the Texas coast 2017 The Marine Meteorology Division which is located in Monterey California makes important contributions to weather forecasting in the United States and around the world by making publicly available imagery from 18 weather satellites Satellite images of hurricanes and cyclones that provide advanced warning of impending severe weather often originate the from Naval Research Lab Monterey as seen recently during hurricane Harvey 9 NRL is also involved in weather forecasting models such as the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model released in 2007 NRL s spacecraft development program continues today with the TacSat-4 experimental tactical reconnaissance communication satellite In addition to spacecraft design NRL also designs and operates research instruments such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment LASCO 10 aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory SOHO NASA s Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope GLAST was tested at NRL spacecraft testing facilities 11 NRL scientists have most recently contributed leading research to the study of novas 12 13 and gamma ray bursts 14 15 16 17 Materials science edit NRL has a long history of contributions to materials science dating back to the use of Industrial radiography with gamma rays for the nondestructive inspection of metal casings and welds on Navy vessels beginning in the 1920s Modern mechanical fracture mechanics were pioneered at NRL and were subsequently applied to solve fracture problems in Navy vessels commercial aircraft and Polaris missiles That knowledge is in widespread use today in applications ranging from design of nuclear reactors to aircraft submarines and toxic material storage tanks 3 NRL developed the synthesis of high-purity GaAs crystals used in a myriad of modern high frequency transceivers including cellular phones satellite communication systems commercial and military radar systems including those aboard all US combat aircraft and ARM Phoenix AIM-9L and AMRAAM missiles NRL s GaAs inventions were licensed by Rockwell Westinghouse Texas Instruments and Hughes Research 18 High-purity GaAs is also used for high-efficiency solar cells like those aboard NASA s Spirit and Opportunity rovers currently on Mars 19 Fundamental aspects of stealth technology were developed at NRL including the radar absorption mechanisms in ferrite-containing materials 18 Metal bearing surface treatments using Cr ion implantation researched at NRL nearly tripled the service life of Navy turbine engine parts and was adopted for Army helicopter parts as well 18 Fluorinated polyurethane coatings developed at NRL are used to line fuel storage tanks throughout the US Navy reducing leakage and environmental and fuel contamination The same polymer films are used in Los Angeles-class submarine radomes to repel water and enable radar operation soon after surfacing 18 Scientists at NRL frequently contribute theoretical and experimental research on novel materials 20 21 22 particularly magnetic materials 23 24 25 26 27 28 and nanomaterials 29 30 31 32 and thermoplastic 33 Radar edit The first modern US radar was invented and developed at NRL in Washington DC in 1922 By 1939 NRL installed the first operational radar aboard the USS New York in time for radar to contribute to naval victories of the Coral Sea Midway and Guadalcanal NRL then further developed over-the-horizon radar as well as radar data displays 3 NRL s Radar Division 34 continues important research development contributing to US Navy and US Department of Defense capabilities Tactical electronic warfare edit NRL s Tactical Electronic Warfare TEW Division 35 is responsible for research and development in support of the Navy s tactical electronic warfare requirements and missions These include electronic warfare support measures electronic countermeasures and supporting counter-countermeasures as well as studies analyses and simulations for determining and improving the performance of Electronic Warfare systems NRL TEW includes aerial surface and ground EW within its scope NRL is responsible for the identification friend or foe IFF system and a number of other advances Information security edit The Information Technology Division 36 has a world-class information security R D group which is where the IETF s IP Security IPsec protocols were originally developed The Encapsulating Security Payload ESP protocol developed at NRL is widely used for virtual private network VPN connections worldwide 37 The projects developed by the laboratory often become mainstream applications without public awareness of the developer an example in computer science is onion routing the core principle of the anonymizing Tor software 38 Nuclear research edit Nuclear power research was initiated at NRL as early as 1939 3 six years before the first atomic bomb for the purpose of powering submarines Uranium enrichment methods sponsored by NRL over the course of World War II were adopted by the Manhattan Project 39 and guided the design of Oak Ridge National Laboratory s Uranium enrichment plant NRL is currently developing laser focusing techniques aimed at inertial confinement fusion technology 40 Physical sciences edit The Static discharger seen on trailing edges of virtually all modern aircraft was originally developed by NRL scientists during World War II After the war the laboratory developed modern synthetic lubricants 41 42 initially for use in the Navy s jet aircraft but they were subsequently adopted by the commercial jet industry 3 In the late 1960s NRL researched low-temperature physics achieving for the first time a temperature within one millionth of a degree of absolute zero in 1967 In 1985 two scientists at the laboratory Herbert A Hauptman and Jerome Karle won the Nobel Prize for devising direct methods employing X-ray diffraction analysis in the determination of crystal structures 43 Their methods form the basis for the computer packages used in pharmaceutical labs and research institutions worldwide for the analysis of more than 10,000 new substances each year 44 NRL has most recently published research on quantum computing 45 46 quantum dots 47 plasma shockwaves 48 thermodynamics of liquids 49 modeling of oil spills 50 and other topics NRL operates a small squadron of research aircraft termed Scientific Development Squadron One VXS-1 Its missions include for example Rampant Lion which used sophisticated airborne instrumentation gravimeters magnetometers and hyperspectral cameras to collect precise 3D topography of two-thirds of Aghanistan and locate natural resources underground gas and mineral deposits vegetation types etc there 51 and in Iraq and Colombia 52 Plasma science edit The Division of Plasma Science conducts research and development into ionized matter NRL currently holds the world record for most energetic rail gun projectile 33 MJ 53 and fastest manmade projectile 334 million MPH 54 Organization edit Naval Research Laboratory seal used before 2016 The laboratory is divided into four research directorates one financial directorate and one executive directorate All the directorates are headquartered in Washington DC Many directorates have other facilities elsewhere primarily at either the Stennis Space Center in Bay St Louis Mississippi or in Monterey California Staff edit Most NRL staff are civilians in the Civil Service with a relatively small number of Navy enlisted personnel or officers In addition there are some support contractors that work on-site at NRL As of 31 December 2015 across all NRL locations NRL had 2540 civilian employees ie not including civilian contractors 55 On the same date there were 35 military officers on-board NRL and 58 enlisted on-board NRL most of whom are with NRL s VXS-1 Scientific Flight Detachment which is located aboard the Patuxent River Pax River Naval Air Station NAS in southern Maryland 56 NRL has special authority to use a Pay-Band pay system instead of using the traditional General Schedule GS pay system for its civilian employees 57 58 This gives NRL more ability to pay employees based on performance and merit rather than time-in-grade or some other seniority metric There are several different pay-band groups at NRL each being for different categories of civilian employees As of 31 December 2015 NRL had 1615 civilian scientists engineers in the NP pay system 103 civilian technicians in the NR pay system 383 civilian administrative specialists professionals in the NO pay system and 238 civilian administrative support staff in the NC pay system 56 NRL scientists engineers typically are in the NP pay group in NRL s Pay Band system 57 The NP-II pay band is equivalent to GS-5 Step 1 through GS-10 Step 10 The NP-III pay band is equivalent to GS-11 Step 1 through GS-13 Step 10 NRL s Pay Band IV corresponds to the GS-14 Step 1 to GS-15 Step 10 pay grades inclusive while NRL s Pay Band V can pay above GS-15 Step 10 and corresponds to the Senior Technologist ST pay grade elsewhere in the US Government s Civil Service A new graduate scientist or engineer with a Bachelor of Science degree typically is hired with a salary equivalent to a GS-7 while a new graduate scientist or engineer with a Master of Science degree typically at the equivalent of a GS-11 According to the NRL Fact Book 2016 NRL had 870 employees with a Doctorate 417 employees with a master s degree as their highest degree and 576 employees with a bachelor s degree as their highest degree 56 The laboratory also hosts post-doctoral researchers and was voted 15 in the Best Places to Work PostDocs 2013 survey 59 Research directorates edit The four research directorates within NRL are The Systems Directorate Code 5000 is responsible for performing a range of activities from basic

Survivability to develop and test techniques and equipment for shipboard fire fighting NRL operates several synchrotron radiation beamlines and the Extreme-Ultraviolet and X-Ray Calibration Facility at the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory History edit Early history edit Artifacts found on the NRL campus such as stone tools and ceramic shards show that the site had been inhabited since the Late Archaic Period Cecil Calvert 2nd Baron Baltimore granted the tract of land including the present NRL campus to William Middleton in 1663 It became part of the District of Columbia in 1791 and was purchased by Thomas Grafton Addison in 1795 who named the area Bellevue and built a mansion on the highlands to the east Zachariah Berry purchased the land in 1827 who rented it out for various purposes including a fishery at Blue Plains The mansion was demolished during the Civil War to build Fort Greble In 1873 the land was purchased by the federal government as the Bellevue Annex to the Naval Gun Factory and several buildings were constructed including the Commandant s house Quarters A which is still in use today 65 Foundation edit NRL in 1923 the first year of its existence showing the first five buildings on its campus The Naval Research Laboratory came into existence from an idea that originated from Thomas Edison In a May 1915 editorial piece in the New York Times Magazine Edison wrote The Government should maintain a great research laboratory In this could be developedall the technique of military and naval progression without any vast expense 66 This statement addressed concerns about World War I in the United States 67 Edison then agreed to serve as the head of the Naval Consulting Board that consisted of civilians who had achieved expertise The focus of the Naval Consulting Board was as advisor to the US Navy pertaining to science and technology The board brought forward a plan to create a modern facility for the Navy In 1916 Congress allocated 1.5 million for implementation However construction was delayed until 1920 because of the war and internal disagreements within the board 67 The US Naval Research Laboratory the first modern research institution created within the United States Navy began operations at 1100 on 2 July 1923 The Laboratory s two original divisions Radio and Sound performed research in the fields of high-frequency radio and underwater sound propagation 67 They produced communications equipment direction-finding devices sonar sets and perhaps most significant of all the first practical radar equipment built in the United States They performed basic research participating for example in the discovery and early exploration of the ionosphere Moreover the NRL was able to work gradually toward its goal of becoming a broadly based research facility By the beginning of World War II five new divisions had been added Physical Optics Chemistry Metallurgy Mechanics and Electricity and Internal Communications 67 World War II years and growth edit NRL in 1944 after significant wartime growth Total employment at the NRL jumped from 396 in 1941 to 4400 in 1946 expenditures from 1.7 million to 13.7 million the number of buildings from 23 to 67 and the number of projects from 200 to about 900 During World War II scientific activities necessarily were concentrated almost entirely on applied research New electronics equipment radio radar sonar was developed Countermeasures were devised New lubricants were produced as were antifouling paints luminous identification tapes and a sea marker to help save survivors of disasters at sea A thermal diffusion process was conceived and used to supply some of the U-235 isotope needed for one of the first atomic bombs Also many new devices that developed from booming wartime industry were type tested and then certified as reliable for the Fleet 67 After WWII edit NRL in 2001 As a result of the scientific accomplishments of the WWII the United States emerged into the postwar era determined to consolidate its wartime gains in science and technology and to preserve the working relationship between its armed forces and the scientific community While the Navy was establishing the Office of Naval Research ONR as a liaison with and supporter of basic and applied scientific research the Navy encouraged NRL to broaden its scope since it was the Navy Department s corporate research laboratory NRL was placed under the administrative oversight of ONR after ONR was created NRL s Commanding Officer reports to the Navy s Chief of Naval Research CNR The Chief of Naval Research leads the Office of Naval Research which primarily is located in the Ballston area of Arlington Virginia The reorganization also caused a parallel shift of the Laboratory s emphasis to one of long-range basic and applied research in the full range of the physical sciences 2 However rapid expansion during the war had left NRL improperly structured to address long-term Navy requirements One major task neither easily nor rapidly accomplished was that of reshaping and coordinating research This was achieved by transforming a group of largely autonomous scientific divisions into a unified institution with a clear mission and a fully coordinated research program The first attempt at reorganization vested power in an executive committee composed of all the division superintendents This committee was impracticably large so in 1949 a civilian director of research was named and given full authority over the program Positions for associate directors were added in 1954 2 Modern era edit In 1992 the previously separate Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research Laboratory NOARL with centers in Bay St Louis Mississippi and Monterey California was merged into NRL Since then NRL is also the lead Navy center for research in Oceanographic and Atmospheric Sciences with special strengths in physical oceanography marine geosciences ocean acoustics marine meteorology and remote oceanic and atmospheric sensing 67 See also edit Military of the United States portal United States Navy portal United States Marine Corps
