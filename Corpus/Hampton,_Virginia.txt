Captain Christopher Newport they sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to North America After a long voyage they first landed at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay on the south shore at a place they named Cape Henry for Henry Frederick Prince of Wales the elder son of their king During the first few days of exploration they identified the site of Old Point Comfort which they originally named Point Comfort as a strategic defensive location at the entrance to the body of water that became known as Hampton Roads This is formed by the confluence of the Elizabeth Nansemond and James rivers The latter is the longest river in Virginia Weeks later on May 14 1607 they established the first permanent English settlement in the present-day United States about 25 miles 40 km further inland from the Bay which became the site of fortifications during the following 200 years Slightly south near the entrance to Hampton River the colonists seized the Native American community of Kecoughtan under Virginia s Governor Sir Thomas Gates The colonists established their own small town with a small Anglican church known now as St John s Episcopal Church on July 9 1610 This came to be known as part of Hampton Hampton claims to be the oldest continuously occupied English settlement in the United States 9 Hampton was named for Henry Wriothesley 3rd Earl of Southampton an important leader of the Virginia Company of London for whom the Hampton River Hampton Roads and Southampton County were also named The area became part of Elizabeth Cittie sic in 1619 Elizabeth River Shire in 1634 and was included in Elizabeth City County when it was formed in 1643 By 1680 the settlement was known as Hampton and it was incorporated as a town in 1705 and became the seat of Elizabeth City County In the latter part of August 1619 an English ship flying a Dutch flag the White Lion appeared off shore from Point Comfort Its cargo included 20 plus Africans captured from the slave ship Sao Joao Bautista These were the first Africans to come ashore on English-occupied land in what would become the United States John Rolfe the widower of Pocahontas wrote in a letter that he was at Point Comfort and witnessed the arrival of the first Africans Although these first Bantu men from Angola were considered indentured servants their arrival marked the beginning of slavery in North America Two of the first Africans to arrive at Old Point Comfort in 1619 were Antoney and Isabella Their child the first of African descent born in North America was born baptized January 1624 Shortly after the War of 1812 the US Army built a more substantial stone facility at Old Point Comfort It was called Fort Monroe in honor of President James Monroe The new installation and adjacent Fort Calhoun on a man-made island across the channel were completed in 1834 Fort Monroe Hampton and the surrounding area played several important roles during the American Civil War 1861 1865 Although most of Virginia became

community in the United States A number of modern-day Hampton streets retain their names from that community The large number of contrabands who sought the refuge of Fort Monroe and the Grand Contraband Camp led to educational efforts which eventually included establishment of Hampton University site of the famous Emancipation Oak The original site of the Native American s Kecoughtan
