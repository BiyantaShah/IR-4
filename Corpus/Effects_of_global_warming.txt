Effects of global warming This article is primarily about effects during the 21st century For longer-term effects see Long-term effects of global warming See also Effects of global warming on humans Summary of climate change impacts Projected global warming in 2100 for a range of emission scenarios The effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused directly or indirectly by human emissions of greenhouse gases There is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and that human activities are the primary driver 1 Many impacts of climate change have already been observed including glacier retreat 2 changes in the timing of seasonal events 2 eg earlier flowering of plants 3 and changes in agricultural productivity 2 Future effects of climate change will vary depending on climate change policies 4 and social development 5 The two main policies to address climate change are reducing human greenhouse gas emissions climate change mitigation and adapting to the impacts of climate change 6 Geoengineering is another policy option 6 Near-term climate change policies could significantly affect long-term climate change impacts 4 7 Stringent mitigation policies might be able to limit global warming in 2100 to around 2 C or below relative to pre-industrial levels 8 Without mitigation increased energy demand and extensive use of fossil fuels 9 might lead to global warming of around 4 C 10 11 Higher magnitudes of global warming would be more difficult to adapt to 12 and would increase the risk of negative impacts 13 Definitions See also attribution of recent climate change In this article climate change means a change in climate that persists over a sustained period of time 14 15 The World Meteorological Organization defines this time period as 30 years 14 Examples of climate change include increases in global surface temperature global warming changes in rainfall patterns and changes in the frequency of extreme weather events Changes in climate may be due to natural causes eg changes in the sun s output or due to human activities eg changing the composition of the atmosphere 16 Any human-induced changes in climate will occur against a background of natural climatic variations 16 and of variations in human activity such as population growth on shores or in arid areas which increase or decrease climate vulnerability 17 Also the term anthropogenic forcing refers to the influence exerted on a habitat or chemical environment by humans as opposed to a natural process 18 Temperature changes Global mean surface temperature change since 1880 relative to the 1951 1980 mean Source NASA GISS The graph above shows the average of a set of temperature simulations for the 20th century black line followed by projected temperatures for the 21st century based on three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios colored lines 19 This article breaks down some of the impacts of climate change according to different levels of future global warming This way of describing impacts has for instance been used in the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports on climate change 20 The instrumental temperature record shows global warming of around 0.6 C during the 20th century 21 SRES emissions scenarios The future level of global warming is uncertain but a wide range of estimates projections have been made 22 The IPCC s SRES scenarios have been frequently used to make projections of future climate change 23 22 24 The SRES scenarios are baseline or reference scenarios which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit GHG emissions eg the UNFCCC s Kyoto Protocol and the Canc n agreements 24 Emissions projections of the SRES scenarios are broadly comparable in range to the baseline emissions scenarios that have been developed by the scientific community 22 25 In the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report changes in future global mean temperature were projected using the six SRES marker emissions scenarios 26 Emissions projections for the six SRES marker scenarios are representative of the full set of forty SRES scenarios 27 For the lowest emissions SRES marker scenario B1 see the SRES article for details on this scenario the best estimate for global mean temperature is an increase of 1.8 C 3.2 F 26 by the end of the 21st century This projection is relative to global temperatures at the end of the 20th century 28 The likely range greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement 29 for the SRES B1 marker scenario is 1.1 2.9 C 2.0 5.2 F 26 For the highest emissions SRES marker scenario A1FI the best estimate for global mean temperature increase is 4.0 C 7.2 F with a likely range of 2.4 6.4 C 4.3 11.5 F 26 The range in temperature projections partly reflects 1 the choice of emissions scenario and 2 the climate sensitivity 23 22 24 For 1 different scenarios make different assumptions of future social and economic development eg economic growth population level energy policies which in turn affects projections of greenhouse gas GHG emissions 23 22 24 The projected magnitude of warming by 2100 is closely related to the level of cumulative emissions over the 21st century ie total emissions between 2000 2100 30 The higher the cumulative emissions over this time period the greater the level of warming is projected to occur 30 2 reflects uncertainty in the response of the climate system to past and future GHG emissions which is measured by the climate sensitivity 23 22 24 Higher estimates of climate sensitivity lead to greater projected warming while lower estimates of climate sensitivity lead to less projected warming 31 Over the next several millennia projections suggest that global warming could be irreversible 32 Even if emissions were drastically reduced global temperatures would remain close to their highest level for at least 1,000 years see the later section on irreversibilities 33 34 Projected warming in context Scientists have used various proxy data to assess past changes in Earth s climate paleoclimate 36 Sources of proxy data include historical records such as farmers logs tree rings corals fossil pollen ice cores and ocean and lake sediments 36 Analysis of these data suggest that recent warming is unusual in the past 400 years possibly longer 37 By the end of the 21st century temperatures may increase to a level not experienced since the mid-Pliocene around 3 million years ago 38 At that time models suggest that mean global temperatures were about 2 3 C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures 38 Even a 2 C rise above the pre-industrial level would be outside the range of temperatures experienced by human civilization 35 39 Physical impacts Main article Physical impacts of climate change This set of graphs show changes in climate indicators over several decades Each of the different colored lines in each panel represents an independently analyzed set of data The data come from many different technologies including weather stations satellites weather balloons ships and buoys 41 A broad range of evidence shows that the climate system has warmed 42 Evidence of global warming is shown in the graphs opposite Some of the graphs show a positive trend eg increasing temperature over land and the ocean and sea level rise Other graphs show a negative trend eg decreased snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and declining Arctic sea ice extent Evidence of warming is also apparent in living biological systems 43 Human activities have contributed to a number of the observed changes in climate 44 This contribution has principally been through the burning of fossil fuels which has led to an increase in the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere 45 Another human influence on the climate are sulfur dioxide emissions which are a precursor to the formation of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere 46 Human-induced warming could lead to large-scale irreversible and or abrupt changes in physical systems 47 48 An example of this is the melting of ice sheets which contributes to sea level rise 49 The probability of warming having unforeseen consequences increases with the rate magnitude and duration of climate change 50 Effects on weather Observations show that there have been changes in weather 51 As climate changes the probabilities of certain types of weather events are affected Projected change in annual average precipitation by the end of the 21st century based on a medium emissions scenario SRES A1B Credit NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory 52 53 Changes have been observed in the amount intensity frequency and type of precipitation 23 18 Widespread increases in heavy precipitation have occurred even in places where total rain amounts have decreased With medium confidence see footnote 1 IPCC 2012 54 concluded that human influences had contributed to an increase in heavy precipitation events at the global scale Projections of future changes in precipitation show overall increases in the global average but with substantial shifts in where and how precipitation falls 23 24 Projections suggest a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions 53 In other words regions which are dry at present will in general become even drier while regions that are currently wet will in general become even wetter 53 This projection does not apply to every locale and in some cases can be modified by local conditions 53 Extreme weather See also Extreme weather and Tropical cyclone Global warming Over most land areas since the 1950s it is very likely that there have been fewer or warmer cold days and nights 55 Hot days and nights have also very likely become warmer or more frequent 55 Human activities have very likely contributed to these trends 55 There may have been changes in other climate extremes eg floods droughts and tropical cyclones but these changes are more difficult to identify 55 Projections suggest changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events 55 Confidence in projections varies over time 55 Near-term projections 2016 2035 Some changes eg more frequent hot days will probably be evident in the near term while other near-term changes eg more intense droughts and tropical cyclones are more uncertain 55 Long-term projections 2081 2100 Future climate change will be associated with more very hot days and fewer very cold days 55 The frequency length and intensity of heat waves will very likely increase over most land areas 55 Higher growth in anthropogenic GHG emissions will be associated with larger increases in the frequency and severity of temperature extremes 56 Assuming high growth in GHG emissions IPCC scenario RCP8.5 presently dry regions may be affected by an increase in the risk of drought and reductions in soil moisture 57 Over most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropical regions extreme precipitation events will very likely become more intense and frequent 55 Tropical cyclones At the global scale the frequency of tropical cyclones will probably decrease or be unchanged 58 Global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and precipitation rates will likely increase 58 Changes in tropical cyclones will probably vary by region but these variations are uncertain 58 Effects of climate extremes The impacts of extreme events on the environment and human society will vary Some impacts will be beneficial eg fewer cold extremes will probably lead to fewer cold deaths 59 Overall however impacts will probably be mostly negative 60 61 Cryosphere See also Retreat of glaciers since 1850 A map of the change in thickness of mountain glaciers since 1970 Thinning in orange and red thickening in blue A map that shows ice concentration on 16 September 2012 along with the extent of the previous record low yellow line and the mid-September median extent black line setting a new record low that was 18 percent smaller than the previous record and nearly 50 percent smaller than the long-term 1979 2000 average The cryosphere is made up of areas of the Earth which are covered by snow or ice 62 Observed changes in the cryosphere include declines in Arctic sea ice extent 63 the widespread retreat of alpine glaciers 64 and reduced snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere 65 Solomon et al 2007 66 assessed the potential impacts of climate change on summertime Arctic sea ice extent Assuming high growth in greenhouse gas emissions SRES A2 some models projected that Arctic sea ice in the summer could largely disappear by the end of the 21st century 66 More recent projections suggest that the Arctic summers could be ice-free defined as ice extent less than 1 million square km as early as 2025 2030 67 During the 21st century glaciers 68 and snow cover are projected to continue their widespread retreat 69 In the western mountains of North America increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation are projected to lead to reduced snowpack 70 Snowpack is the seasonal accumulation of slow-melting snow 71 The melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could contribute to sea level rise especially over long time-scales see the section on Greenland and West Antarctic Ice sheets 49 Changes in the cryosphere are projected to have social impacts 72 For example in some regions glacier retreat could increase the risk of reductions in seasonal water availability 73 Barnett et al 2005 74 estimated that more than one-sixth of the world s population rely on glaciers and snowpack for their water supply Oceans Main article Effects of global warming on oceans The role of the oceans in global warming is complex The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere but increased levels of CO 2 have led to ocean acidification Furthermore as the temperature of the oceans increases they become less able to absorb excess CO 2 The ocean have also acted as a sink in absorbing extra heat from the atmosphere 75 4 The increase in ocean heat content is much larger than any other store of energy in the Earth s heat balance over the two periods 1961 to 2003 and 1993 to 2003 and accounts for more than 90 of the possible increase in heat content of the Earth system during these periods 76 Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets and warming of the ocean surface leading to increased temperature stratification Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation Acidification Main article Ocean acidification This map shows changes in the amount of aragonite dissolved in ocean surface waters between the 1880s and the most recent decade 2003 2012 77 Historical modeling suggests that since the 1880s increased CO2 has led to lower aragonite saturation levels less availability of minerals in the oceans around the world 77 The largest decreases in aragonite saturation have occurred in tropical waters 77 However decreases in cold areas may be of greater concern because colder waters typically have lower aragonite levels to begin with 77 About one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity has already been taken up by the oceans 78 As carbon dioxide dissolves in sea water carbonic acid is formed which has the effect of acidifying the ocean measured as a change in pH The uptake of human carbon emissions since the year 1750 has led to an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units 79 Projections using the SRES emissions scenarios suggest a further reduction in average global surface ocean pH of between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century The effects of ocean acidification on the marine biosphere have yet to be documented 79 Laboratory experiments suggest beneficial effects for a few species with potentially highly detrimental effects for a substantial number of species 78 With medium confidence Fischlin et al 2007 80 projected that future ocean acidification and climate change would impair a wide range of planktonic and shallow benthic marine organisms that use aragonite to make their shells or skeletons such as corals and marine snails pteropods with significant impacts particularly in the Southern Ocean Oxygen depletion The amount of oxygen dissolved in the oceans may decline with adverse consequences for ocean life 81 82 Sea level rise Main article Current sea level rise See also Future sea level Trends in global average absolute sea level 1870 2008 83 There is strong evidence that global sea level rose gradually over the 20th century 84 With high confidence Bindoff et al 2007 85 concluded that between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries the rate of sea level rise increased Authors of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Synthesis Report IPCC AR4 SYR 2007 21 reported that between the years 1961 and 2003 global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 mm per year mm yr with a range of 1.3 2.3 mm yr Between 1993 and 2003 the rate increased above the previous period to 3.1 mm yr range of 2.4 3.8 mm yr Authors of IPCC AR4 SYR 2007 21 were uncertain whether the increase in rate from 1993 to 2003 was due to natural variations in sea level over the time period or whether it reflected an increase in the underlying long-term trend There are two main factors that have contributed to observed sea level rise 84 The first is thermal expansion as ocean water warms it expands 86 The second is from the contribution of land-based ice due to increased melting The major store of water on land is found in glaciers and ice sheets Anthropogenic forces very likely greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement 29 contributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century 44 There is a widespread consensus that substantial long-term sea level rise will continue for centuries to come 87 In their Fourth Assessment Report the IPCC 88 projected sea level rise to the end of the 21st century using the SRES emissions scenarios Across the six SRES marker scenarios sea level was projected to rise by 18 to 59 cm 7.1 to 23.2 in relative to sea level at the end of the 20th century 89 Thermal expansion is the largest component in these projections contributing 70 75 of the central estimate for all scenarios 90 Due to a lack of scientific understanding this sea level rise estimate does not include all of the possible contributions of ice sheets see the section on Greenland and West Antarctic Ice sheets An assessment of the scientific literature on climate change was published in 2010 by the US National Research Council US NRC 2010 91 NRC 2010 91 described the projections in AR4 ie those cited in the above paragraph as conservative and summarized the results of more recent studies Cited studies suggested a great deal of uncertainty in projections 91 A range of projections suggested possible sea level rise by the end of the 21st century of between 0.56 and 2 m relative to sea levels at the end of the 20th century 91 Ocean temperature rise Global ocean heat content from 1955 2012 From 1961 to 2003 the global ocean temperature has risen by 0.10 C from the surface to a depth of 700 m There is variability both year-to-year and over longer time scales with global ocean heat content observations showing high rates of warming for 1991 2003 but some cooling from 2003 to 2007 92 The temperature of the Antarctic Southern Ocean rose by 0.17 C 0.31 F between the 1950s and the 1980s nearly twice the rate for the world s oceans as a whole 93 As well as having effects on ecosystems eg by melting sea ice affecting algae that grow on its underside warming reduces the ocean s ability to absorb CO 2 citation needed It is likely greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement 29 that anthropogenic forcing contributed to the general warming observed in the upper several hundred metres of the ocean during the latter half of the 20th century 44 Regions Main article Regional effects of global warming Temperatures across the world in the 1880s left and the 1980s right as compared to average temperatures from 1951 to 1980 94 Projected changes in average temperatures across the world in the 2050s under three greenhouse gas GHG emissions scenarios 19 Regional effects of global warming vary in nature Some are the result of a generalised global change such as rising temperature resulting in local effects such as melting ice In other cases a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system In such cases the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate melting or forming ice changing the hydrological cycle of evaporation and precipitation and changing currents in the oceans and air flows in the atmosphere The coast can also be considered a region and will suffer severe impacts from sea level rise Observed impacts With very high confidence Rosenzweig et al 2007 43 concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes particularly regional temperature increases Impacts include earlier leafing of trees and plants over many regions movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in the Northern Hemisphere changes in bird migrations in Europe North America and Australia and shifting of the oceans plankton and fish from cold- to warm-adapted communities 95 The human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming with greater temperature increases over land and in polar regions rather than over the oceans 96 6 Using models it is possible to identify the human signal of global warming over both land and ocean areas 96 6 Projected impacts Projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale 96 9 It is however expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already with greatest warming over land and high northern latitudes and least over the Southern Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean 97 Nearly all land areas will very likely warm more than the global average 98 The Arctic Africa small islands and Asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate change 99 Low-latitude less-developed areas are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate change 100 Developed countries are also vulnerable to climate change 101 For example developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some extreme weather events such as heat waves 101 In all regions some people can be particularly at risk from climate change such as the poor young children and the elderly 99 100 102 Social systems Main articles Effects of climate change on humans and Climate change industry and society See also Climate change and gender The impacts of climate change can be thought of in terms of sensitivity and vulnerability Sensitivity is the degree to which a particular system or sector might be affected positively or negatively by climate change and or climate variability Vulnerability is the degree to which a particular system or sector might be adversely affected by climate change 103 The sensitivity of human society to climate change varies Sectors sensitive to climate change include water resources coastal zones human settlements and human health Industries sensitive to climate change include agriculture fisheries forestry energy construction insurance financial services tourism and recreation 104 105 Food supply Main article Climate change and agriculture See also Food security Food vs fuel and 2007 2008 world food price crisis Graph of net crop production worldwide and in selected tropical countries Raw data from the United Nations 2 Climate change will impact agriculture and food production around the world due to the effects of elevated CO2 in the atmosphere higher temperatures altered precipitation and transpiration regimes increased frequency of extreme events and modified weed pest and pathogen pressure 106 In general low-latitude areas are at most risk of having decreased crop yields 107 As of 2007 the effects of regional climate change on agriculture have been small 43 Changes in crop phenology provide important evidence of the response to recent regional climate change 108 Phenology is the study of natural phenomena that recur periodically and how these phenomena relate to climate and seasonal changes 109 A significant advance in phenology has been observed for agriculture and forestry in large parts of the Northern Hemisphere 43 Projections Projected changes in crop yields at different latitudes with global warming This graph is based on several studies 110 Projected changes in yields of selected crops with global warming This graph is based on several studies 110 With low to medium confidence Schneider et al 2007 20 projected that for about a 1 to 3 C increase in global mean temperature by the years 2090 2100 relative to average temperatures in the years 1990 2000 there would be productivity decreases for some cereals in low latitudes and productivity increases in high latitudes With medium confidence global production potential was projected to 20 increase up to around 3 C very likely decrease above about 3 C Most of the studies on global agriculture assessed by Schneider et al 2007 107 had not incorporated a number of critical factors including changes in extreme events or the spread of pests and diseases Studies had also not considered the development of specific practices or technologies to aid adaptation to climate change 107 The graphs opposite show the projected effects of climate change on selected crop yields 111 Actual changes in yields may be above or below these central estimates 111 The projections above can be expressed relative to pre-industrial 1750 temperatures 112 0.6 C of warming is estimated to have occurred between 1750 and 1990 2000 Add 0.6 C to the above projections to convert them from a 1990 2000 to pre-industrial baseline Food security Easterling et al 2007 113 assessed studies that made quantitative projections of climate change impacts on food security It was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations However the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings The first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of hunger compared with reference scenarios with no climate change Climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development Additionally the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development In 2006 the global estimate for the number of people undernourished was 820 million 114 Under the SRES A1 B1 and B2 scenarios see the SRES article for information on each scenario group projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560 700 million people with a global total of undernourished people of 100 240 million in 2080 By contrast the SRES A2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels The smaller reduction under A2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario Droughts and agriculture Some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa southern Europe the Middle East most of the Americas Australia and Southeast Asia 115 However other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years 116 Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand population growth urban expansion and environmental protection efforts in many areas 117 Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock 118 Health Main article Effects of global warming on human health Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns temperature precipitation sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events and indirectly through changes in water air and food quality and changes in ecosystems agriculture industry and settlements and the economy Confalonieri et al 2007 393 59 According to an assessment of the scientific literature by Confalonieri et al 2007 393 59 the effects of climate change to date have been small but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions A study by the World Health Organization WHO 2009 119 estimated the effect of climate change on human health Not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates for example the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded Climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3 of diarrhoea 3 of malaria and 3.8 of dengue fever deaths worldwide in 2004 Total attributable mortality was about 0.2 of deaths in 2004 of these 85 were child deaths Projections With high confidence authors of the IPCC AR4 Synthesis report 120 48 projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas such as fewer deaths from cold exposure and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa Benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures especially in developing countries With very high confidence Confalonieri et al 2007 59 393 concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change Economic growth on its own however was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world s population from disease and injury due to climate change Future vulnerability to climate change will depend not only on the extent of social and economic change but also on how the benefits and costs of change are distributed in society 121 For example in the 19th century rapid urbanization in western Europe lead to a plummeting in population health 121 Other factors important in determining the health of populations include education the availability of health services and public-health infrastructure 59 393 Water resources See also Water security Precipitation during the 20th century and up through 2008 during global warming the NOAA estimating an observed trend over that period of 1.87 global precipitation increase per century A number of climate-related trends have been observed that affect water resources These include changes in precipitation the crysosphere and surface waters eg changes in river flows 122 Observed and projected impacts of climate change on freshwater systems and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature sea level and precipitation variability 123 Sea level rise will extend areas of salinization of groundwater and estuaries resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas In an assessment of the scientific literature Kundzewicz et al 2007 123 concluded with high confidence that the negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits All of the regions assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Africa Asia Australia and New Zealand Europe Latin America North America Polar regions Arctic and Antarctic and small islands showed an overall net negative impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystems Semi-arid and arid areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater With very high confidence it was judged that many of these areas eg the Mediterranean basin Western United States Southern Africa and north-eastern Brazil would suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change Migration and conflict See also Environmental migrant General circulation models project that the future climate change will bring wetter coasts drier mid-continent areas and further sea level rise 124 Such changes could result in the gravest effects of climate change through human migration 125 Millions might be displaced by shoreline erosions river and coastal flooding or severe drought Migration related to climate change is likely to be predominantly from rural areas in developing countries to towns and cities 124 407 126 In the short term climate stress is likely to add incrementally to existing migration patterns rather than generating entirely new flows of people 126 110 It has been argued that environmental degradation loss of access to resources eg water resources 127 and resulting human migration could become a source of political and even military conflict 128 Factors other than climate change may however be more important in affecting conflict For example Wilbanks et al 2007 129 suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in Africa were more to do with the relative abundance of resources eg oil and diamonds than with resource scarcity Scott et al 2001 placed only low confidence in predictions of increased conflict due to climate change 128 A 2013 study found that significant climatic changes were associated with a higher risk of conflict worldwide and predicted that amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries 130 Similarly a 2014 study found that higher temperatures were associated with a greater likelihood of violent crime and predicted that global warming would cause millions of such crimes in the United States alone during the 21st century 131 Military planners are concerned that global warming is a threat multiplier Whether it is poverty food and water scarcity diseases economic instability or threat of natural disasters the broad range of changing climatic conditions may be far reaching These challenges may threaten stability in much of the world 132 Aggregate impacts Main article Economic impacts of climate change Aggregating impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and or regions 133 Examples of aggregate measures include economic cost eg changes in gross domestic product GDP and the social cost of carbon changes in ecosystems eg changes over land area from one type of vegetation to another 134 human health impacts and the number of people affected by climate change 135 Aggregate measures such as economic cost require researchers to make value judgements over the importance of impacts occurring in different regions and at different times Observed impacts Global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather-related events since the 1970s 136 Socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses eg population growth increased wealth 137 Part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors eg changes in precipitation and flooding events It is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend 137 The trend does however suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate change 137 138 Projected impacts The total economic impacts from climate change are highly uncertain 139 With medium confidence Smith et al 2001 140 concluded that world GDP would change by plus or minus a few percent for a small increase in global mean temperature up to around 2 C relative to the 1990 temperature level Most studies assessed by Smith et al 2001 140 projected losses in world GDP for a medium increase in global mean temperature above 2 3 C relative to the 1990 temperature level with increasing losses for greater temperature increases This assessment is consistent with the findings of more recent studies as reviewed by Hitz and Smith 2004 141 Economic impacts are expected to vary regionally 141 142 For a medium increase in global mean temperature 2 3 C of warming relative to the average temperature between 1990 2000 market sectors in low-latitude and less-developed areas might experience net costs due to climate change 20 On the other hand market sectors in high-latitude and developed regions might experience net benefits for this level of warming A global mean temperature increase above about 2 3 C relative to 1990 2000 would very likely result in market sectors across all regions experiencing either declines in net benefits or rises in net costs 49 Aggregate impacts have also been quantified in non-economic terms For example climate change over the 21st century is likely to adversely affect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal flooding reductions in water supplies increased malnutrition and increased health impacts 61 Biological systems Main article Climate change and ecosystems See also Extinction risk from global warming Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity Effects of climate change on terrestrial animals and Effects of climate change on marine mammals Observed impacts on biological systems A vast array of physical and biological systems across the Earth are being affected by human-induced global warming 95 With very high confidence Rosenzweig et al 2007 concluded that recent warming had strongly affected natural biological systems 43 Hundreds of studies have documented responses of ecosystems plants and animals to the climate changes that have already occurred 143 For example in the Northern Hemisphere species are almost uniformly moving their ranges northward and up in elevation in search of cooler temperatures 144 Humans are very likely causing changes in regional temperatures to which plants and animals are responding 144 Projected impacts on biological systems By the year 2100 ecosystems will be exposed to atmospheric CO 2 levels substantially higher than in the past 650,000 years and global temperatures at least among the highest of those experienced in the past 740,000 years 145 Significant disruptions of ecosystems are projected to increase with future climate change 146 Examples of disruptions include disturbances such as fire drought pest infestation invasion of species storms and coral bleaching events The stresses caused by climate change added to other stresses on ecological systems eg land conversion land degradation harvesting and pollution threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of some unique ecosystems and extinction of some critically endangered species 146 147 Climate change has been estimated to be a major driver of biodiversity loss in cool conifer forests savannas mediterranean-climate systems tropical forests in the Arctic tundra and in coral reefs 148 In other ecosystems land-use change may be a stronger driver of biodiversity loss at least in the near-term 148 Beyond the year 2050 climate change may be the major driver for biodiversity loss globally 148 A literature assessment by Fischlin et al 2007 145 included a quantitative estimate of the number of species at increased risk of extinction due to climate change With medium confidence it was projected that approximately 20 to 30 of plant and animal species assessed so far in an unbiased sample would likely be at increasingly high risk of extinction should global mean temperatures exceed a warming of 2 to 3 C above pre-industrial temperature levels 145 The uncertainties in this estimate however are large for a rise of about 2 C the percentage may be as low as 10 or for about 3 C as high as 40 and depending on biota all living organisms of an area the flora and fauna considered as a unit 149 the range is between 1 and 80 148 As global average temperature exceeds 4 C above pre-industrial levels model projections suggested that there could be significant extinctions 40 70 of species that were assessed around the globe 148 Assessing whether future changes in ecosystems will be beneficial or detrimental is largely based on how ecosystems are valued by human society 150 For increases in global average temperature exceeding 1.5 to 2.5 C relative to global temperatures over the years 1980 1999 151 and in concomitant atmospheric CO 2 concentrations projected changes in ecosystems will have predominantly negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems goods and services eg water and food supply 152 Abrupt or irreversible changes Physical ecological and social systems may respond in an abrupt non-linear or irregular way to climate change 153 This is as opposed to a smooth or regular response A quantitative entity behaves irregularly when its dynamics are discontinuous ie not smooth nondifferentiable unbounded wildly varying or otherwise ill-defined 153 Such behaviour is often termed singular Irregular behaviour in Earth systems may give rise to certain thresholds which when crossed may lead to a large change in the system Some singularities could potentially lead to severe impacts at regional or global scales 154 Examples of large-scale singularities are discussed in the articles on abrupt climate change climate change feedback and runaway climate change It is possible that human-induced climate change could trigger large-scale singularities but the probabilities of triggering such events are for the most part 155 poorly understood 154 With low to medium confidence Smith et al 2001 153 concluded that a rapid warming of more than 3 C above 1990 levels would exceed thresholds that would lead to large-scale discontinuities in the climate system Since the assessment by Smith et al 2001 improved scientific understanding provides more guidance for two large-scale singularities the role of carbon cycle feedbacks in future climate change discussed below in the section on biogeochemical cycles and the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets 141 Biogeochemical cycles See also climate change feedback Climate change may have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive feedback process A feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process A positive feedback intensifies the original process and a negative feedback reduces it 120 78 Models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive 156 792 Using the A2 SRES emissions scenario Schneider et al 2007 156 789 found that this effect led to additional warming by the years 2090 2100 relative to the 1990 2000 of 0.1 1.5 C This estimate was made with high confidence The climate projections made in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report summarized earlier of 1.1 6.4 C account for this feedback effect On the other hand with medium confidence Schneider et al 2007 156 789 commented that additional releases of GHGs were possible from permafrost peat lands wetlands and large stores of marine hydrates at high latitudes Greenland and West Antarctic Ice sheets With medium confidence authors of AR4 49 concluded that with a global average temperature increase of 1 4 C relative to temperatures over the years 1990 2000 at least a partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheets would occur The estimated timescale for partial deglaciation was centuries to millennia and would contribute 4 to 6 metres 13 to 20 ft or more to sea level rise over this period Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation See also Shutdown of thermohaline circulation This map shows the general location and direction of the warm surface red and cold deep water blue currents of the thermohaline circulation Salinity is represented by color in units of the Practical Salinity Scale Low values blue are less saline while high values orange are more saline 157 The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation AMOC is an important component of the Earth s climate system characterized by a northward flow of warm salty water in the upper layers of the Atlantic and a southward flow of colder water in the deep Atlantic 158 5 The AMOC is equivalently known as the thermohaline circulation THC 141 Potential impacts associated with MOC changes include reduced warming or in the case of abrupt change absolute cooling of northern high-latitude areas near Greenland and north-western Europe an increased warming of Southern Hemisphere high-latitudes tropical drying as well as changes to marine ecosystems terrestrial vegetation oceanic CO 2 uptake oceanic oxygen concentrations and shifts in fisheries 159 According to an assessment by the US Climate Change Science Program CCSP 2008b 158 5 it is very likely greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement 158 12 that the strength of the AMOC will decrease over the course of the 21st century Warming is still expected to occur over most of the European region downstream of the North Atlantic Current in response to increasing GHGs as well as over North America Although it is very unlikely less than 10 probability based on expert judgement 158 12 that the AMOC will collapse in the 21st century the potential consequences of such a collapse could be severe 158 5 Irreversibilities Commitment to radiative forcing Emissions of GHGs are a potentially irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing in the future 160 The contribution of a GHG to radiative forcing depends on the gas s ability to trap infrared heat radiation the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere and the length of time the gas resides in the atmosphere 160 CO 2 is the most important anthropogenic GHG 161 While more than half of the CO 2 emitted is currently removed from the atmosphere within a century some fraction about 20 of emitted CO 2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years 162 Consequently CO 2 emitted today is potentially an irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing over thousands of years This commitment may not be truly irreversible should techniques be developed to remove CO 2 or other GHGs directly from the atmosphere or to block sunlight to induce cooling 32 Techniques of this sort are referred to as geoengineering Little is known about the effectiveness costs or potential side-effects of geoengineering options 163 Some geoengineering options such as blocking sunlight would not prevent further ocean acidification 163 Irreversible impacts Human-induced climate change may lead to irreversible impacts on physical biological and social systems 164 There are a number of examples of climate change impacts that may be irreversible at least over the timescale of many human generations 165 These include the large-scale singularities described above changes in carbon cycle feedbacks the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets and changes to the AMOC 165 In biological systems the extinction of species would be an irreversible impact 165 In social systems unique cultures may be lost due to climate change 165 For example humans living on atoll islands face risks due to sea-level rise sea-surface warming and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events 166 Benefits of global warming In some locations and industries global warming may increase productivity though the IPCC cautions that Estimates agree on the size of the impact small relative to economic growth and 17 of the 20 impact estimates shown in Figure 10-1 are negative Losses accelerate with greater warming and estimates diverge 167 The identified benefits are listed below CO2 fertilisation effect CO2 is one of the substances which plants require to grow Increasing its amount in the air contributes to Improved agriculture in some high latitude regions 168 Increased growing season in Greenland 169 Increased productivity of sour orange trees 170 Increased vegetation activity in high northern latitudes 171 Increased plankton biomass in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre 172 Recent increase in forest growth 173 Increased Arctic tundra plant reproduction 174 Human health Winter deaths might decline as temperatures warm However this is disputed for at least some regions For example 175 states Although excess winter deaths evidently do exist winter cold severity no longer predicts the numbers affected We conclude that no evidence exists that excess winter deaths in England and Wales will fall if winters warm with climate change Ice-free Northwest Passage Ships will travel on a shorter route between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans 176 Animal population changes Some animals will benefit from the warming Increase in chinstrap and gentoo penguins 177 Bigger marmots 178 Scientific opinion The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has published several major assessments on the effects of global warming 179 Its most recent comprehensive impact assessment was published in 2014 180 Publications describing the effects of climate change have also been produced by the following organizations American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS 181 A report by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and Wageningen University and Research Centre 182 UK AVOID research programme 183 A report by the UK Royal Society and US National Academy of Sciences 184 University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre 185 US National Research Council 186 187 A report by Molina et al no date 188 states The overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systems NASA data and tools NASA has released public data and tools to predict how temperature and rainfall patterns worldwide may change through to the year 2100 caused by increasing carbon dioxide in Earth s atmosphere The dataset shows projected changes worldwide on a regional level simulated by 21 climate models The data can be viewed on a daily timescale for individual cities and towns and may be used to conduct climate risk assessments to predict the local and global effects of weather dangers for example droughts floods heat waves and declines in agriculture productivity and help plan responses to global warming effects 189 See also Footnotes 1 The TAR 190 and AR4 29 that are referred to in this article use specific and quantitative language to describe uncertainty This language is intended to provide an indication of the level of confidence that IPCC authors have about a particular finding The qualitative language used to describe uncertainty has a quantitative scale associated with it The quantitative values for qualitative terms are intended to ensure that confidence levels are interpreted correctly The is because qualitative statements eg using the word likely can be interpreted differently in quantitative terms 191 44 Confidence levels used in the TAR 192 Very High 95 or greater High 67 95 Medium 33 67 Low 5 33 Very Low 5 or less Confidence statements made in AR4 are listed below 29 Very high confidence At least 9 out of 10 chance of being correct High confidence About 8 out of 10 chance Medium confidence About 5 out of 10 chance Low confidence About 2 out of 10 chance Very low confidence Less than a 1 out of 10 chance IPCC 2012 193 uses the following terms very low low medium high and very high confidence Unlike the TAR and AR4 the scale is qualitative rather than quantitative The quantitative values used by IPCC authors are subjective probabilities 29 190 194 also known as personalist or Bayesian probabilities 195 and reflect the expert judgement of IPCC authors In this formulation probability is not only a function of an event but also the state of information that is available to the person making the assessment 195 In this framework assigned probabilities may change as more or different information becomes available 195 The IPCC also uses another scale to describe the likelihood of a particular event occurring 29 This is different from the confidence scales described above and it is possible to assign confidence values to statements of likelihood For example the judgement that an event is improbable eg rolling a dice twice and getting a six both times may be assigned a high level of scientific confidence 29 Also the probability that an event has an even chance of occurring eg a tossed coin coming up heads may also be assigned a high level of confidence 29 Notes Allison I et al 2009 The Copenhagen Diagnosis 2009 Updating the world on the Latest Climate Science Sydney Australia The University of New South Wales
