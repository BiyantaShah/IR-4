Japan Meteorological Agency The Japan Meteorological Agency Kish -ch JMA is an agency of the Ministry of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism 4 It is charged with gathering and providing results for the public in Japan that are obtained from data based on daily scientific observation and research into natural phenomena in the fields of meteorology hydrology seismology and volcanology among other related scientific fields Its headquarters is located in Chiyoda Tokyo JMA is responsible for gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts for the general public as well as providing aviation and marine weather JMA other responsibilities include issuing warnings for volcanic eruptions and the nationwide issuance of earthquake warnings of the Earthquake Early Warning EEW system JMA is also designated one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers of the World Meteorological Organization WMO It is responsible for forecasting naming and distributing warnings for tropical cyclones in the Northwestern Pacific region including the Celebes Sea the Sulu Sea the South China Sea the East China Sea the Yellow Sea the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk History edit August 26 1872 The first weather station in Japan set up in Hakodate Hokkaido It is the precursor of the present Hakodate Weather Station Hakodate Kaiy Kish -dai 1 June 1875 The original Tokyo Meteorological Observatory T ky Kish -dai was formed within the Survey Division of Geography Bureau of Home Ministry Naimu-sh Chiri-ry Ry chi-ka 1 5 January 1 1887 The Tokyo Meteorological Observatory was renamed as the Central Meteorological Observatory Ch Kish -dai with the transfer of its jurisdiction to the Home Ministry April 1895 The Ministry of Education Monbush replaced the preceding ministry as an administrator of the Observatory January 1 1923 The main office moved to Motoe-machi K jimachi-ku later Takehira-ch 1 where it is near a moat surrounding the Imperial Palace 6 November 1943 The Ministry of Transport and Communications Un yu T shin-sh took over the CMO s operation May 1945 It became part of the Ministry of Transport Un yu-sh July 1 1956 The Central Meteorological Observatory became an agency of the Ministry of Transport and has been renamed to the Japan Meteorological Agency Kish -ch March 1964 The headquarters office was relocated to the present building in temachi Chiyoda-ku January 6 2001 The JMA becomes an agency of the Ministry of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism Kokudo-k ts -sh with the Japanese government reformation 2013 It has been announced that it would be scheduled to move the headquarters into Toranomon Minato-ku 6 Services edit Overview edit The JMA is responsible not only for gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts in Japan but also for observation and warning of earthquakes tsunamis typhoons and volcanic eruptions 7 The agency has six regional administrative offices including five DMOs and Okinawa Meteorological Observatory four Marine Observatories five auxiliary facilities four Aviation Weather Service Centers and 47 local offices composed of the LMOs These are also used to gather data supplemented by weather satellites such as Himawari and other research institutes 7 In 1968 the World Meteorological Organization WMO designated the JMA as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre RSMC for Asia 8 In June 1988 the WMO also assigned the JMA as a RSMC for the Northwestern Pacific under its Tropical Cyclone programme 8 In July 1989 the RSMC Tokyo Typhoon Center was established within the headquarters office which dealt with the forecasting and dissemination of active tropical cyclones as well as preparing a summary of each year s cyclone activity 9 Observation and forecast edit Weather edit Land weather edit Each DMO and LMO issues weather forecasts and warnings or advisories to the general public live in its own area Weather data used to these forecasts are acquired from the Surface Observation represented by the AMeDAS the Radar Observation the Upper-air Observation and the Satellite Observation mainly using the Himawari series Marine weather edit See also Marine weather forecasting The Marine Observatories are seated in Hakodate Maizuru Kobe and Nagasaki These stations observe ocean waves tide levels sea surface temperature and ocean current etc in the Northwestern Pacific basin as well as the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk basin and provide marine meteorological forecasts resulted from them in cooperation with the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department Japan Coast Guard Aviation weather edit See also METAR and SIGMET In 2005 in accordance with the ICAO s new CNS ATM system the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism set up the Air Traffic Management Center ATMC in Fukuoka where the FIR is fixed Along with this establishment JMA placed the Air Traffic Meteorology Center ATMetC inside the ATMC The agency forecasts SIGMET for aircraft in flight within the Fukuoka FIR airspace while VOLMET is broadcast by each Aviation Weather Service Centers at the airports of Haneda Narita Centrair and Kansai Additionally Aviation Weather Stations beside the airports of New Chitose Sendai Osaka Fukuoka Kagoshima and Naha deal with the similar tasks as these Tropical cyclones edit See also Typhoon and 2017 Pacific typhoon season In the Northwestern Pacific area the typhoon season ordinarily comes almost from May to November The JMA forecasts and warns or advises on tropical cyclones to the public in Japan and its surrounding countries as well because it also works as the RSMC Tokyo Typhoon Center 10 Earthquakes edit See also Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale and Earthquake Early Warning Japan The JMA has its own 624 observation stations across the country 11 that set up at intervals of 20 km approximately 12 in order to measure seismic intensity of earthquakes precisely The agency also utilize about 2,900 more seismographs 11 owned by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention NIED and local governments A 24-hour office has been housed within the JMA headquarters in Tokyo for monitoring and tracking seismic events in the vicinity of Japan to collect and process their data which issues observed earthquake s information on its hypocenter magnitude seismic intensity and possibility of tsunami occurrence after quakes quickly to the public through the Earthquake Phenomena Observation System EPOS 13 The Earthquake Early Warning EEW system began to work fully for the general public on October 1 2007 The agency is one of the representatives of the national Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction 14 Tsunamis edit See also Tsunami warning system It is essential to provide coastal regions for tsunami information so that its catastrophic damages can be reduced and mitigated there In case of there is a possibility of tsunami after an earthquake JMA issues Tsunami Warning or Advisory for each region in Japan with information of estimated tsunami heights and arrival times within 2 to 3 minutes of the quake Volcanos edit See also Volcanic Ash Advisory Center The agency set up four Volcanic Observations and Information Centers within DMOs in Sapporo Sendai Tokyo and Fukuoka They are monitoring volcanic events on 110 active volcanos in Japan and 47 of these volcanos selected by the Coordinating Committee for Prediction of Volcanic Eruption are under the 24-hour observation with seismographs accelerometers GPS air-shock recorders fixed point observation cameras and other equipment If it is predicted that a volcanic eruption will affect inhabited areas or are around a crater Volcanic Warnings are issued and supplemented by Volcanic Alert Levels Organization edit Headquarters edit JMA Headquarters Kish -ch Honch Director-General Ch kan Deputy Director-General Jich
