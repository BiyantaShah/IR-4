Persian alphabet a modified variant of the Arabic script The Persian language is classified as a continuation of Middle Persian the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire itself a continuation of Old Persian the language of the Achaemenid Empire 10 11 12 Its grammar is similar to that of many contemporary European languages 13 Persian gets its name from its origin at the capital of the Achaemenid Empire Persis modern-day Fars Province hence the name Persian Farsi 14 A Persian-speaking person may be referred to as Persophone 15 There are approximately 110 million Persian speakers worldwide with the language holding official status in Iran Afghanistan and Tajikistan For centuries Persian has also been a prestigious cultural language in other regions of Western Asia Central Asia and South Asia by the various empires based in the regions 16 Persian has had a considerable mainly lexical influence on neighboring languages particularly the Turkic languages in Central Asia Caucasus and Anatolia neighboring Iranian languages as well as Armenian Georgian and Indo-Aryan languages especially Urdu a register of Hindustani It also exerted some influence on Arabic particularly Bahrani Arabic 17 while borrowing much vocabulary from it after the Arab conquest of Iran 10 13 18 19 20 21 22 With a long history of literature in the form of Middle Persian before Islam Persian was the first language in the Muslim world to break through Arabic s monopoly on writing and the writing of poetry in Persian was established as a court tradition in many eastern courts 16 Some of the famous works of Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi the works of Rumi the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi the Div n of Hafez and the two miscellanea of prose and verse by Saadi Shirazi the Gulistan and the Bustan Classification edit Persian is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-European family Other Western Iranian languages are the Kurdish languages Gilaki Mazanderani Talysh and Balochi Persian is classified as a member of the Southwestern subgroup within Western Iranian along with Lari Kumzari and Luri 23 Etymology edit Persian language name in Persian edit In Persian the language is known by several names Western Persian Parsi p rsi or Farsi f rsi or zab n-e f rsi has been the name used by all native speakers until the 20th century In recent decades some authors writing in English have referred to the variety of Persian spoken in Iran as Farsi 24 25 although the name Persian is also still widely used 26 27 28 Eastern Persian Dari Persian dar or f rsi-ye dari was originally a synonym for F rsi but since the latter decades of the 20th century has become the name for the variety of Persian spoken in Afghanistan where it is one of the two official languages it is sometimes called Afghan Persian in English 29 Tajiki tojik or zabon-i tojiki is the variety of Persian spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by the Tajiks Persian language name in English edit Persian the historically more widely used name of the language in English is an anglicized form derived from Latin Persianus Latin Persia Greek Pers s Persia 30 a Hellenized form of Old Persian P rsa 31 According to the Oxford English Dictionary the term Persian as a language name is first attested in English in the mid-16th century 32 Native Iranian Persian speakers call it F rsi 33 Farsi is the Arabicized form of P rsi subsequent to Muslim conquest of Persia due to a lack of the phoneme p in Standard Arabic ie the p was replaced with an f 34 35 36 The origin of the name Farsi and the place of origin of the language which is Fars Province is the Arabicized form of P rs 34 35 36 In English this language has historically been known as Persian though Farsi has also gained some currency Farsi is encountered in some linguistic literature as a name for the language used both by Iranian and by foreign authors 37 In modern English the word Farsi refers to the language while Parsi or Parsee describes Zoroastrians particularly in South Asia The Academy of Persian Language and Literature has declared that the name Persian is more appropriate as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity 38 Some Persian language scholars such as Ehsan Yarshater editor of Encyclop dia Iranica and University of Arizona professor Kamran Talattof have also rejected the usage of Farsi in their articles 39 40 The international language-encoding standard ISO 639-1 uses the code fa as its coding system is mostly based on the local names The more detailed standard ISO 639-3 uses the name Persian code fas for the dialect continuum spoken across Iran and Afghanistan This consists of the individual languages Dari Afghan Persian and Iranian Persian 41 Currently Voice of America BBC World Service Deutsche Welle and Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty use Persian Service for their broadcasts in the language Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty also includes a Tajik service and an Afghan Dari service This is also the case for the American Association of Teachers of Persian The Centre for Promotion of Persian Language and Literature and many of the leading scholars of the Persian language 42 History edit Persian is an Iranian language belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family of languages In general Iranian languages are known from three periods usually referred to as Old Middle and New Modern periods These correspond to three eras in Iranian history Old era being the period from sometime before Achaemenids the Achaemenid era and sometime after Achaemenids that is to 400 300 BC Middle era being the next period most officially Sassanid era and sometime in post-Sassanid era and the New era being the period afterwards down to present day 43 According to available documents the Persian language is the only Iranian language 10 for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that Old Middle and New Persian represent 10 44 one and the same language of Persian that is New Persian is a direct descendant of Middle and Old Persian 44 The known history of the Persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods Old Persian edit Main articles Old Persian and Persian verbs Old Persian As a written language Old Persian is attested in royal Achaemenid inscriptions The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the Behistun Inscription 45 Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now Iran Romania Gherla 46 47 48 Armenia Bahrain Iraq Turkey and Egypt 49 50 Old Persian is one of the oldest Indo-European languages which is attested in original texts 51 Xenophon a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC which is at a time when Old Persian was the only form of Persian used He relates that the Armenians spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians 52 Middle Persian edit Main article Middle Persian The complex grammatical conjugation and declension of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared leaving only singular and plural as did gender Middle Persian developed the ez fe construction expressed through modern ye to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system Although the middle period of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century However Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era 224 651 inscriptions so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty Moreover as a literary language Middle Persian is not attested until much later to the 6th or 7th century And from the 8th century onward Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of Zoroastrianism The native name of Middle Persian was Parsig or Parsik after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest that is of Pars Old Persian Parsa New Persian Fars This is the origin of the name Farsi as it is today used to signify New Persian Following the collapse of the Sassanid state Parsik came to be applied exclusively to either Middle or New Persian that was written in the Arabic script From about the 9th century onward as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian the older form of the language came to be erroneously called Pahlavi which was actually but one of the writing systems used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids who were Persians ie from the southwest from the preceding Arsacids who were Parthians ie from the northeast While Ibn al-Muqaffa eighth century still distinguished between Pahlavi ie Parthian and Persian in Arabic text al-Farisiyah ie Middle Persian this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date Gernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language 53 but also states that none of the known Middle Persian dialects is the direct predecessor of Modern Persian 54 55 Ludwig Paul states The language of the Shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from Middle to New Persian 56 New Persian edit Ferdowsi s Shahnameh New Persian is conventionally divided into three stages Early New Persian 8th 9th centuries Classical Persian 10th 18th centuries Contemporary Persian 19th century to present Early New Persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of Contemporary Persian as the morphology and to a lesser extent the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stable 57 Early New Persian edit New Persian is taken to replace Middle Persian in the course of the 8th to 9th centuries under Abbasid rule 58 With the decline of the Abbasids began the reestablishment of Persian national life and Persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters New Persian as an independent literary language first emerges in Bactria through the adaptation of the spoken form of Sassanian Middle Persian court language called Dari The cradle of the Persian literary renaissance lay in the east of Greater Iran in Greater Khorasan and Transoxiana close to the Amu Darya Modern day Afghanistan 59 The mastery of the newer speech having now been transformed from Middle into New Persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of Iranian origin the Tahirid dynasty 820 872 Saffarid dynasty 860 903 and Samanid Empire 874 999 and could develop only in range and power of expression 59 Abbas of Merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer Persian tongue and after him the poems of Hanzala Badghisi were among the most famous between the Persian-speakers of the time 60 The first poems of the Persian language a language historically called Dari emerged in Afghanistan 61 The first significant Persian poet was Rudaki He flourished in the 10th century when the Samanids were at the height of their power His reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived although little of his poetry has been preserved Among his lost works is versified fables collected in the Kalila wa Dimna 16 The language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which among others Central Asian Turks became familiar with Islam and urban culture New Persian was widely used as a trans-regional lingua franca a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least 19th century 58 In the late Middle Ages new Islamic literary languages were created on the Persian model Ottoman Turkish Chagatai and Urdu which are regarded as structural daughter languages of Persian 58 Classical Persian edit See also List of Persian poets and authors Kalilah va Dimna an influential work in Persian literature Classical Persian loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval Persia used in literature and poetry This is the language of the 10th to 12th centuries which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the Persianized Turko-Mongol dynasties during the 12th to 15th centuries and under restored Persian rule during the 16th to 19th centuries 62 Persian during this time served as lingua franca of Greater Persia and of much of the Indian subcontinent It was also the official and cultural language of many Islamic dynasties including the Samanids Buyids Tahirids Ziyarids the Mughal Empire Timurids Ghaznavids Seljuqs Khwarazmians the Sultanate of Rum the Shirvanshahs Safavids Afsharids Zands Qajars Ottomans and also many Mughal successors such as the Nizam of Hyderabad Persian was the only non-European language known and used by Marco Polo at the Court of Kublai Khan and in his journeys through China 63 Use in Asia Minor edit Persian on an Ottoman miniature Despite Anatolia having been ruled at various times prior to the Middle Ages by various Persian-speaking dynasties originating in Iran the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the Sasanian Empire Centuries later however the practise and usage of Persian in the region would be strongly revived A branch of the Seljuks the Sultanate of Rum took Persian language art and letters to Anatolia 64 They adopted Persian language as the official language of the empire 65 The Ottomans which can roughly be seen as their eventual successors took this tradition over Persian was the official court language of the empire and for some time the official language of the empire 66 The educated and noble class of the Ottoman Empire all spoke Persian such as sultan Selim I despite being Safavid Iran s archrival and a staunch opposer of Shia Islam 67 It was a major literary language in the empire 68 Some of the noted earlier Persian works during the Ottoman rule are Idris Bidlisi s Hasht Bihisht which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight Ottoman rulers and the Salim-Namah a glorification of Selim I 67 After a period of several centuries Ottoman Turkish which was highly Persianised itself had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation 69 However the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88 69 Use in South Asia edit Main article Persian language in South Asia See also Persian and Urdu Persian poem Agra Fort India 18th century Persian poem Takht-e Shah Jahan Agra Fort India The Persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in West Asia Europe Central Asia and South Asia Following the Turko-Persian Ghaznavid conquest of South Asia Persian was firstly introduced in the region by Turkic Central Asians 70 The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties 64 For five centuries prior to the British colonization Persian was widely used as a second language in the Indian subcontinent due to the admiration the Mughals who were of Turco-Mongol origin had for the foreign language It took prominence as the language of culture and education in several Muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole official language under the Mughal emperors Beginning in 1843 though English and Hindustani gradually replaced Persian in importance on the subcontinent 71 Evidence of Persian s historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the Indian subcontinent Words borrowed from Persian are still quite commonly used in certain Indo-Aryan languages especially Urdu also historically known as Hindustani There is also a small population of Zoroastrian Iranis in India who migrated around 16th-18th century to escape religious execution in Qajar Iran and speak a Dari dialect Contemporary Persian edit A variant of the Iranian standard ISIRI 9147 keyboard layout for Persian In the 19th century under the Qajar dynasty the dialect spoken in Tehran rose to prominence This became the basis of what is now known as Contemporary Standard Persian There is still substantial Arabic vocabulary but many of these words have been integrated into Persian phonology and grammar In addition since the 19th century numerous Russian French and English terms have been borrowed especially vocabulary related to technology The Iranian National Academy of Persian Language and Literature is responsible for evaluating neologisms in order to devise their Persian equivalents Varieties edit There are three modern varieties of standard Persian Western Persian Persian Iranian Persian or Farsi is spoken in Iran and by minorities in Iraq and the Persian Gulf states Dari Dari Persian Afghan Persian or Dari is spoken in Afghanistan Tajiki Tajik Persian is spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan It is written in the Cyrillic script All these three varieties are based on the classic Persian literature and its literary tradition There are also several local dialects from Iran Afghanistan and Tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard Persian The Hazaragi dialect in Central Afghanistan and Pakistan Herati in Western Afghanistan Darwazi in Afghanistan and Tajikistan and the Tehrani accent in Iran the basis of standard Iranian Persian are examples of these dialects Persian-speaking peoples of Iran Afghanistan and Tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility 72 The following are some languages closely related to Persian or in some cases are considered dialects Luri or Lori spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian provinces of Lorestan Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province some western parts of Fars Province and some parts of Khuzestan Province Lari in southern Iran Tat spoken in parts of Azerbaijan Russia and Transcaucasia It is classified as a variety of Persian 73 74 75 76 77 Judeo-Tat Part of the Tat Persian continuum and spoken in Azerbaijan Russia as well as notably by immigrant communities in Israel and New York Phonology edit Main article Persian phonology Iranian Persian has six vowels and twenty-three consonants Vowels edit The vowel phonemes of modern Tehran Persian Historically Persian has distinguished length Early New Persian had a series of five long vowels i u o and e along with three short vowels i and u At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran e and i merged into i and o and u merged into u Thus older contrasts such as sh r lion vs sh r milk and z d quick vs z r strong were lost However there are exceptions to this rule and in some words and are preserved citation needed or merged into the diphthongs e and o which are descendants of the diphthongs and in Early New Persian instead of merging into i and u Examples of the exception can be found in words such as ro n bright However in Dari the archaic distinction of e and i respectively known as Y -ye majh l and Y -ye ma r f is still preserved as well as the distinction of o and u known as W w-e majh l and W w-e ma r f On the other hand in standard Tajik the length distinction has disappeared and i merged with i and u with u 78 Therefore contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian According to most studies on the subject eg Samareh 1977 Pisowicz 1985 Najafi 2001 the three vowels traditionally considered long i u are currently distinguished from their short counterparts e o by position of articulation rather than by length However there are studies eg Hayes 1979 Windfuhr 1979 that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system with i and u phonologically long or bimoraic and e and o phonologically short or monomoraic There are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system such as Toosarvandani 2004 That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Persian which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature The length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties including Tajik Consonants edit Grammar edit Main article Persian grammar Morphology edit Suffixes predominate Persian morphology though there are a small number of prefixes 79 Verbs can express tense and aspect and they agree with the subject in person and number 80 There is no grammatical gender in Persian and pronouns are not marked for natural gender Syntax edit Normal declarative sentences are structured as S PP O V sentences have optional subjects prepositional phrases and objects followed by a compulsory verb If the object is specific the object is followed by the word r and precedes prepositional phrases S O r PP V 80 Vocabulary edit Main article Persian vocabulary Native word formation edit Persian makes extensive use of word building and combining affixes stems nouns and adjectives Persian frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns adjectives and verbal stems New words are extensively formed by compounding two existing words combining into a new one as is common in German Influences edit See also List of English words of Persian origin List of French loanwords in Persian and Iranian languages Comparison table of the Iranian languages While having a lesser influence on Arabic 19 and other languages of Mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of Middle Persian origin 13 New Persian contains a considerable amount of Arabic lexical items 10 18 20 which were Persianized 21 and often took a different meaning and usage than the Arabic original Persian loanwords of Arabic origin especially include Islamic terms The Arabic vocabulary in other Iranian Turkic and Indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from New Persian not from Arabic itself 81 John R Perry in his article Lexical Areas and Semantic Fields of Arabic estimates that about 24 percent of an everyday vocabulary of 20,000 words in current Persian and more than 25 percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern Persian literature are of Arabic origin The text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area It may approach 25 percent of a text in literature 82 Among the Arabic loan words relatively few 14 percent are from the semantic domain of material culture while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual life 83 Most of the Arabic words used in Persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in Persian 84 The inclusion of Mongolian and Turkic elements in the Persian language should also be mentioned 85 not only because of the political role a succession of Turkic dynasties played in Iranian history but also because of the immense prestige Persian language and literature enjoyed in the wider non-Arab Islamic world which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a Turkic background The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military pastoral terms and political sector titles administration etc 86 New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian eg arte for army instead of the Uzbek qo shin sarla kar dary b n etc in the 20th century Persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages especially other Indo-European languages such as Armenian 87 Urdu and to a lesser extent Hindi the latter two through conquests of Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan invaders 88 Turkic languages such as Ottoman Turkish Chagatai Tatar Turkish 89 Turkmen Azeri 90 Uzbek and Karachay-Balkar 91 Caucasian languages such as Georgian 92 and to a lesser extent Avar and Lezgin 93 Afro-Asiatic languages like Assyrian List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Arabic 94 and even Dravidian languages indirectly especially Telugu and Brahui as well as Austronesian languages such as Indonesian and Malay Persian has also had a significant lexical influence via Turkish on Albanian Serbian Croatian Bosnian and Serbo-Croatian particularly as spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina Use of occasional foreign synonyms instead of Persian words can be a common practice in everyday communications as an alternative expression In some instances in addition to the Persian vocabulary the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used For example in Iranian colloquial Persian not in Afghanistan or Tajikistan the phrase thank you may be expressed using the French word merci stressed however on the first syllable the hybrid Persian-Arabic phrase mote akker am mote akker being merciful in Arabic commonly pronounced mot akker in Persian and the verb am meaning I am in Persian or by the pure Persian phrase sep s-goz r am Orthography edit Example showing Nasta l q s Persian proportion rules 1 Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda s personal handwriting a typical cursive Persian script The word Persian in Pahlavi scripts The vast majority of modern Iranian Persian and Dari text is written with the Arabic script Tajiki which is considered by some linguists to be a Persian dialect influenced by Russian and the Turkic languages of Central Asia 95 96 is written with the Cyrillic script in Tajikistan see Tajik alphabet Persian alphabet edit Main article Persian alphabet Modern Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian are written using a modified variant of the Arabic alphabet which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in Arabic Tajik Persian as used in Tajikistan is typically written in a modified version of the Cyrillic script There also exist several romanization systems for Persian After the Muslim conquest of Persia it took approximately 150 years before Persians adopted the Arabic script in place of the older alphabet Previously two different scripts were used Pahlavi used for Middle Persian and the Avestan alphabet in Persian D ndapirak or Din Dabire literally religion script used for religious purposes primarily for the Avestan but sometimes for Middle Persian In the modern Persian script historically short vowels are usually not written only the historically long ones are represented in the text so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing Western Persian kerm worm karam generosity kerem cream and krom chrome are all spelled krm in Persian The reader must determine the word from context The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as harakat is also used in Persian although some of the symbols have different pronunciations For example a ammah is pronounced u while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced o This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature it is primarily used for teaching and in some but not all dictionaries There are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters For example there are four functionally identical letters for z three letters for s two letters for t two letters for h On the other hand there are four letters that don t exist in Arabic Additions edit The Persian alphabet adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet Historically there was used also a special letter for the sound This letter is used no more as the -sound changed to b ie archaic za n z b n language Variations edit The Persian alphabet also modifies some letters of the Arabic alphabet For example alef with hamza below changes to alef words using various hamzas get spelled with yet another kind of hamza so that becomes even though the latter is also correct in Arabic and teh marbuta changes to heh or teh The letters different in shape are Latin alphabet edit Main article Romanization of Persian The International Organization for Standardization has published a standard for simplified transliteration of Persian into Latin ISO 233-3 titled Information and documentation Transliteration of Arabic characters into Latin characters Part 3 Persian language Simplified transliteration 97 but the transliteration scheme is not in widespread use Another Latin alphabet based on the Common Turkic Alphabet was used in Tajikistan in the 1920s and 1930s The alphabet was phased out in favor of Cyrillic in the late 1930s 95 Fingilish
