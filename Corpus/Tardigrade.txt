Tardigrade For members of the suborder sometimes designated Tardigrada see Sloth Tardigrades t rd re d also known colloquially as water bears space bears or moss piglets 2 3 4 5 are water-dwelling eight-legged segmented micro-animals 2 6 They were first discovered by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773 The name Tardigrada meaning slow stepper was given three years later by the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani 7 They have been found everywhere from mountaintops to the deep sea and mud volcanoes 8 from tropical rain forests to the Antarctic 9 Tardigrades are one of the most resilient animals known 10 11 Individual species of tardigrades can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms including complete global mass extinction events due to astrophysical events such as supernovae gamma-ray bursts or large meteorite impacts 10 11 Some tardigrades can withstand temperatures down to 1 K 458 F 272 C close to absolute zero while others can withstand 420 K 300 F 150 C 12 for several minutes pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human and the vacuum of outer space 13 They can go without food or water for more than 30 years drying out to the point where they are 3 or less water only to rehydrate forage and reproduce 3 14 15 16 Tardigrades living in harsh conditions undergo an annual process of cyclomorphosis further explanation needed They are not considered extremophilic because they are not adapted to exploit these conditions This means that their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environments 7 whereas true extremophiles thrive in a physically or geochemically extreme environment that would harm most other organisms 3 17 18 Usually tardigrades are about 0.5 mm 0.02 in 19.69 thou long when they are fully grown 2 They are short and plump with four pairs of legs each with four to eight claws also known as disks 2 The first three pairs of legs are directed ventrolaterally and are the primary means of locomotion while the fourth pair is directed posteriorly on the terminal segment of the trunk and is used primarily for grasping the substrate 19 Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and lichens and feed on plant cells algae and small invertebrates When collected they may be viewed under a very low-power microscope making them accessible to students and amateur scientists 20 Tardigrades form the phylum Tardigrada part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa It is an ancient group with fossils dating from 530 million years ago in the Cambrian period 21 About 1,150 species of tardigrades have been described 22 23 Tardigrades can be found throughout the world from the Himalayas 24 6,000 m 20,000 ft above sea level to the deep sea 4,000 m 13,000 ft and from the polar regions to the equator Description edit Johann August Ephraim Goeze Lazzaro Spallanzani Johann August Ephraim Goeze originally named the tardigrade kleiner Wasserb r B rtierchen today meaning little water bear in German The name Tardigradum means slow walker and was given by Lazzaro Spallanzani in 1776 25 The name water bear comes from the way they walk reminiscent of a bear s gait The biggest adults may reach a body length of 1.5 mm 0.059 in the smallest below 0.1 mm Newly hatched tardigrades may be smaller than 0.05 mm SEM image of Hypsibius dujardini The most convenient place to find tardigrades is on lichens and mosses Other environments are dunes beaches soil and marine or freshwater sediments where they may occur quite frequently up to 25,000 animals per liter Tardigrades in the case of Echiniscoides wyethi 26 may be found on barnacles 27 Often tardigrades can be found by soaking a piece of moss in water 28 Anatomy and morphology edit Tardigrades have barrel-shaped bodies with four pairs of stubby legs Most range from 0.3 to 0.5 mm 0.012 to 0.020 in in length although the largest species may reach 1.2 mm 0.047 in The body consists of a head three body segments with a pair of legs each and a caudal segment with a fourth pair of legs The legs are without joints while the feet have four to eight claws each The cuticle contains chitin and protein and is moulted periodically All adult tardigrades of the same species have the same number of cells see eutely Some species have as many as 40,000 cells in each adult while others have far fewer 29 30 The body cavity consists of a haemocoel but the only place where a true coelom can be found is around the gonad No respiratory organs are found with gas exchange able to occur across the whole of the body Some tardigrades have three tubular glands associated with the rectum these may be excretory organs similar to the Malpighian tubules of arthropods although the details remain unclear 31 The tubular mouth is armed with stylets which are used to pierce the plant cells algae or small invertebrates on which the tardigrades feed releasing the body fluids or cell contents The mouth opens into a triradiate muscular sucking pharynx The stylets are lost when the animal molts and a new pair is secreted from a pair of glands that lie on either side of the mouth The pharynx connects to a short esophagus and then to an intestine that occupies much of the length of the body which is the main site of digestion The intestine opens via a short rectum to an anus located at the terminal end of the body Some species only defecate when they molt leaving the feces behind with the shed cuticle 31 The brain develops in a bilaterally symmetric pattern 32 The brain includes multiple lobes mostly consisting of three bilaterally paired clusters of neurons 33 The brain is attached to a large ganglion below the esophagus from which a double ventral nerve cord runs the length of the body The cord possesses one ganglion per segment each of which produces lateral nerve fibres that run into the limbs Many species possess a pair of rhabdomeric pigment-cup eyes and numerous sensory bristles are on the head and body 34 Tardigrades all possess a buccopharyngeal apparatus swallowing device made of muscles and spines that acts an inner jaw and begins digestion and movement along the throat and intestine 35 which along with the claws is used to differentiate among species Reproduction edit Shed cuticle of female tardigrade containing eggs Although some species are parthenogenic both males and females are usually present each with a single gonad located above the intestine Two ducts run from the testis in males opening through a single pore in front of the anus In contrast females have a single duct opening either just above the anus or directly into the rectum which thus forms a cloaca 31 Tardigrades are oviparous and fertilization is usually external Mating occurs during the molt with the eggs being laid inside the shed cuticle of the female and then covered with sperm A few species have internal fertilization with mating occurring before the female fully sheds her cuticle In most cases the eggs are left inside the shed cuticle to develop but some species attach them to nearby substrate 31 The eggs hatch after no more than 14 days with the young already possessing their full complement of adult cells Growth to the adult size therefore occurs by enlargement of the individual cells hypertrophy rather than by cell division Tardigrades may molt up to 12 times 31 Ecology and life history edit Most tardigrades are phytophagous plant eaters or bacteriophagous bacteria eaters but some are carnivorous to the extent of eating other smaller species of tardigrades eg Milnesium tardigradum 36 37 Tardigrades share morphological characteristics with many species that differ largely by class Biologists have a difficult time finding verification among tardigrade species because of this relationship These animals are most closely related to the early evolution of arthropods 38 Tardigrade fossils go as far back as the Cretaceous period in North America This specific species is considered cosmopolitan and can be located in regions all over the world The eggs and cysts of tardigrades are so resistant to other dangers that they are carried great distances on the feet of other animals to a different location 39 Physiology edit Hypsibius dujardini imaged with a scanning electron microscope Scientists have reported tardigrades in hot springs on top of the Himalayas under layers of solid ice and in ocean sediments Many species can be found in milder environments such as lakes ponds and meadows while others can be found in stone walls and roofs Tardigrades are most common in moist environments but can stay active wherever they can retain at least some moisture Tardigrades are one of the few groups of species that are capable of suspending their metabolism see cryptobiosis Many species of tardigrade can survive in a dehydrated state up to five years or in exceptional cases longer 40 41 Depending on the environment they may enter this state via anhydrobiosis cryobiosis osmobiosis or anoxybiosis While in this state their metabolism lowers to less than 0.01 of normal and their water content can drop to 1 of normal 13 Their ability to remain desiccated for such long periods was thought to be largely dependent on the high levels of the nonreducing sugar trehalose which protects their membranes though recent research suggests that tardigrades have a unique type of disordered protein that serves a similar purpose It replaces water in the cells and adopts a glassy vitrified state when the animals dry out 42 Their DNA is further protected from radiation by a protein called dsup short for damage suppressor 43 44 In this cryptobiotic state the tardigrade is known as a tun 45 Tardigrades are able to survive in extreme environments that would kill almost any other animal Extremes at which tardigrades can survive include those of Temperature tardigrades can survive A few minutes at 151 C 304 F 46 30 years at 20 C 4 F 47 A few days at 200 C 328 F 46 A few minutes at 272 C 458 F 1 K 48 Pressure they can withstand the extremely low pressure of a vacuum and also very high pressures more than 1,200 times atmospheric pressure Tardigrades can survive the vacuum of open space and solar radiation combined for at least 10 days 49 Some species can also withstand pressure of 6,000 atmospheres which is nearly six times the pressure of water in the deepest ocean trench the Mariana trench 29 Dehydration the longest that living tardigrades have been shown to survive in a dry state is nearly 10 years 15 16 although there is one report of leg movement not generally considered survival 50 in a 120-year-old specimen from dried moss 51 When exposed to extremely low temperatures their body composition goes from 85 water to only 3 As water expands upon freezing dehydration ensures the tardigrades do not get ripped apart by the freezing ice 52 Radiation tardigrades can withstand 1,000 times more radiation than other animals 53 median lethal doses of 5,000 Gy of gamma rays and 6,200 Gy of heavy ions in hydrated animals 5 to 10 Gy could be fatal to a human 54 The only explanation found in earlier experiments for this ability was that their lowered water state provides fewer reactants for ionizing radiation 54 However subsequent research found that tardigrades when hydrated still remain highly resistant to shortwave UV radiation in comparison to other animals and that one factor for this is their ability to efficiently repair damage to their DNA resulting from that exposure 55 Irradiation of tardigrade eggs collected directly from a natural substrate moss showed a clear dose-related response with a steep decline in hatchability at doses up to 4 kGy above which no eggs hatched 56 The eggs were more tolerant to radiation late in development No eggs irradiated at the early developmental stage hatched and only one egg at middle stage hatched while eggs irradiated in the late stage hatched at a rate indistinguishable from controls 56 Environmental toxins tardigrades are reported to undergo chemobiosis a cryptobiotic response to high levels of environmental toxins However As of 2001 update these laboratory results have yet to be verified 50 51 Outer space tardigrades are the first known animal to survive in space In September 2007 dehydrated tardigrades were taken into low Earth orbit on the FOTON-M3 mission carrying the BIOPAN astrobiology payload For 10 days groups of tardigrades were exposed to the hard vacuum of outer space or vacuum and solar UV radiation 3 57 58 After being rehydrated back on Earth over 68 of the subjects protected from high-energy UV radiation revived within 30 minutes following rehydration but subsequent mortality was high many of these produced viable embryos 49 59 In contrast hydrated samples exposed to the combined effect of vacuum and full solar UV radiation had significantly reduced survival with only three subjects of Milnesium tardigradum surviving 49 In May 2011 Italian scientists sent tardigrades on board the International Space Station along with extremophiles on STS-134 the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour 60 61 62 Their conclusion was that microgravity and cosmic radiation did not significantly affect survival of tardigrades in flight confirming that tardigrades represent a useful animal for space research 63 In November 2011 they were among the organisms to be sent by the US-based Planetary Society on the Russian Fobos-Grunt mission s Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment to Phobos however the launch failed Tardigrades are one of the few groups to have survived Earth s five mass extinctions 64 Taxonomy edit See also List of bilaterial animal orders Illustration of Echiniscus sp from 1861 Scientists have conducted morphological and molecular studies to understand how tardigrades relate to other lineages of ecdysozoan animals Two plausible placements have been proposed tardigrades are either most closely related to Arthropoda Onychophora or tardigrades are most closely related to nematodes Evidence for the former is a common result of morphological studies evidence of the latter is found in some molecular analyses The latter hypothesis has been rejected by recent microRNA and expressed sequence tag analyses 65 Apparently the grouping of tardigrades with nematodes found in a number of molecular studies is a long branch attraction artifact Within the arthropod group called panarthropoda and comprising onychophora tardigrades and euarthropoda three patterns of relationship are possible tardigrades sister to onychophora plus arthropods the lobopodia hypothesis onychophora sister to tardigrades plus arthropods the tactopoda hypothesis and onychophora sister to tardigrades 66 Recent analyses indicate that the panarthropoda group is monophyletic and that tardigrades are a sister group of Lobopodia the lineage consisting of arthropods and Onychophora 65 67 The minute sizes of tardigrades and their membranous integuments make their fossilization both difficult to detect and highly unusual The only known fossil specimens are those from mid-Cambrian deposits in Siberia and a few rare specimens from Cretaceous amber 68 Echiniscus testudo citation needed The Siberian tardigrade fossils differ from living tardigrades in several ways They have three pairs of legs rather than four they have a simplified head morphology and they have no posterior head appendages but they share with modern tardigrades their columnar cuticle construction 1 Scientists think they represent a stem group of living tardigrades 68 Rare specimens in Cretaceous amber have been found in two North American locations Milnesium swolenskyi from New Jersey is the older of the two its claws and mouthparts are indistinguishable from the living M tardigradum The other specimens from amber are from western Canada some 15 20 million years earlier than M swolenskyi One of the two specimens from Canada has been given its own genus and family Beorn leggi the genus named by Cooper after the character Beorn from The Hobbit by J R R Tolkien and the species named after his student William M Legg however it bears a strong resemblance to many living specimens in the family Hypsibiidae 68 69 Aysheaia from the middle Cambrian Burgess shale has been proposed as a sister taxon to an arthropod-tardigrade clade 70 Tardigrades have been proposed to be among the closest living relatives of the Burgess shale oddity Opabinia 71 Genomes and genome sequencing edit Tardigrade genomes vary in size from about 75 to 800 megabase pairs of DNA 72 Hypsibius dujardini has a compact genome and a generation time of about two weeks it can be cultured indefinitely and cryopreserved 73 The genome of Ramazzottius varieornatus one of the most stress-tolerant species of Tardigrades was sequenced by a team of researchers from the University of Tokyo in 2015 Analysis revealed less than 1.2 of its genes were the result of horizontal gene transfer They also found evidence of a loss of gene pathways that are known to promote damage due to stress This study also found a high expression of novel Tardigrade-unique proteins including Damage suppressor Dsup which was shown to protect against DNA damage from X-ray radiation The same team applied the Dsup protein to human cultured cells and found that it suppressed X-ray damage to the human cells by 40 44 Ecological importance edit Many organisms that live in aquatic environments feed on species such as nematodes tardigrades bacteria algae mites and collembolans 74 Tardigrades work as pioneer species by inhabiting new developing environments in which to live This movement attracts other invertebrates to populate that space while also attracting predators 75 See also edit List of microorganisms
