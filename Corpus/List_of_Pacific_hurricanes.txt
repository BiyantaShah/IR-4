List of Pacific hurricanes This is a list of notable Pacific hurricanes subdivided by reason for notability Notability means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative It includes lists and rankings of Pacific hurricanes by different characteristics and impacts Characteristics include extremes of location such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone Other characteristics include its central pressure windspeed category on the Saffir Simpson scale cyclogenesis outside of a normal hurricane season s timeframe or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960 Another characteristic is how long a system went from formation to dissipation These include the cost of damage the number of casualties as well as meteorological statistics such as rainfall point maxima Hurricane Pauline Impact edit Retired names edit Main article List of retired Pacific hurricane names Additionally Adolph and Israel were removed from the list of names during and after the 2001 season due to political sensitivities Knut was removed from the list in 1988 for unknown reasons Adele Iva and Fefa were also removed in 1970 1988 and 1991 respectively for unknown reasons Hazel was replaced in 1965 1 The name Isis was also pre-emptively removed from the lists of names for 2016 after being deemed inappropriate because of the eponymous militant group in 2015 2 Unnamed but historically significant edit Deadliest tropical cyclones edit Hurricane Paul was the second-deadliest pacific hurricane The following tropical cyclones have caused at least 100 deaths Costliest tropical cyclones edit Damage from Hurricane Manuel The following tropical cyclones have caused at least 750 million in damage Seasonal activity and records edit In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center s CPHC area of responsibility AOR the season with the most tropical cyclones is the 2015 season with 16 cyclones forming in or entering the region A season without cyclones has happened a few times since 1966 most recently in 1979 30 Highest edit Track map of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season the busiest ever recorded Lowest edit Before 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable The geostationary satellite era began in 1966 31 and that year is often considered the first year of reliable tropical records 32 Intensity estimates are most reliable starting in the 1971 season A few years later the Dvorak technique came into use Those two factors make intensity estimates more reliable starting in that year 32 For these reasons seasons prior to 1971 are not included Naming history edit Hurricane Oho the eighth system to receive a central Pacific name in 2015 Naming of tropical cyclones in the eastern north Pacific began in the 1960 season That year four lists of names were created The plan was to proceed in a manner similar to that of the western Pacific that is the name of the first storm in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started This scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four-year rotation starting with the A name each year 33 That same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different On average the eastern north Pacific sees about sixteen named storms per year 34 Named storms per month edit Four of the July cyclones during the 2016 season Before 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable The geostationary satellite era began in 1966 31 and that year is often considered the first year of reliable tropical records 32 Intensity estimates are more reliable starting in the 1971 season A few years later the Dvorak technique came into use Those two make intensity estimates more reliable starting in that year 32 For these reasons seasons before 1966 are not included in the lowest column Shared by more than five seasons Source 35 Off-season storms edit Main article List of off-season Pacific hurricanes A meteorological enigma Hurricane Ekeka formed in January and became a major hurricane The Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 to November 30 36 Only systems that develop or enter during the off-season are included The earliest off-season storm is Pali in 2016 whilst the latest off-season storm was Nine-C during 2015 Entered the basin on this date Unnamed storms edit Main article List of unnamed tropical cyclones The unnamed hurricane of 1975 near the Pacific Northwest Tropical cyclones have received official names in the east-central Pacific region since 1960 Since this time 5 systems that have formed in this area have not received a name plus another possible unnamed subtropical or tropical system in 2006 Tropical Storm 4 1962 Tropical Storm 8 1962 Tropical Storm 4 1963 Hurricane 12 1975 Tropical Storm 1 1996 Strength edit Category 5 edit Main article List of Category 5 Pacific hurricanes Since 1959 only 15 Pacific hurricanes are known to have reached Category 5 and none made landfall while at this intensity 35 Category 4 edit Main article List of Category 4 Pacific hurricanes Since 1900 113 Pacific hurricanes have attained Category 4 intensity of which four made landfall at that strength 35 Duration records edit Hurricane Tina the longest lasting Pacific hurricane east of the international dateline This lists all Pacific hurricanes that existed as tropical cyclones while in the Pacific Ocean east of the dateline for more than two weeks continuously Hurricanes John and Dora spent some time in the west Pacific before dissipating John spent eleven days west of the dateline if that time was included John would have existed for a total of 30 days and 18 hours a world record while including Dora s time in the west Pacific would mean that it existed for 18 days 35 One Atlantic hurricane Hurricane Joan crossed into this basin and was renamed Miriam 45 giving it a total lifespan of 22 days 46 but not all of that was in the Pacific 1993 s Greg formed from the remnants of 1993 s Tropical Storm Bret 45 Its time as an Atlantic system is excluded All of these systems except Trudy Olaf and Connie existed in both the east and central Pacific and all except Olaf were hurricanes Hurricane Trudy of 1990 is thus the longest lived eastern Pacific hurricane to stay in the eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Olaf of 1997 is hence the longest-lived eastern Pacific tropical cyclone not to reach hurricane intensity 35 No known tropical cyclone forming in the central north Pacific lasted for longer than 14 days without crossing into another basin 35 The tropical cyclone forming in the central Pacific that spent the most time there was 2014 s Hurricane Ana at 12.75 days from formation to extratropical transition 47 48 Before the weather satellite era began the lifespans of many Pacific hurricanes may be underestimated 32 Crossover storms edit From Atlantic to Eastern Pacific edit See also List of Atlantic Pacific crossover hurricanes Tracks of Atlantic-Pacific crossovers on both directions This includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossover It used to be that when a Pacific named storm crossed North America and made it to the Atlantic or vice versa it would receive the next name on the respective basin s list However in 2000 this policy was changed so that a tropical cyclone will keep its name if it remains a tropical cyclone during the entire passage Only if it dissipates and then re-forms does it get renamed 59 From Eastern Pacific to Atlantic edit See also List of Atlantic Pacific crossover hurricanes This includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossover In addition to those there are apparently two additional ones One existed before 1856 and made it to the Gulf of Mexico 65 Another Pacific tropical cyclone crossed over central Mexico and also made it to the Gulf sometime after September 9 1924 65 From Eastern Pacific to Western Pacific edit 2014 s Hurricane Genevieve existed in all three north Pacific tropical cyclone basins Neither eastern Pacific tropical cyclones passing 140 W nor central Pacific tropical cyclones crossing the dateline are notable events However very few eastern Pacific proper cyclones that enter the central Pacific make it to the dateline System ceased to be a tropical cyclone before crossing the dateline and subsequently reforming Hurricane Li formed in the eastern Pacific but was not named until it crossed into the central Pacific In addition Hurricane Jimena of 2003 is recognized per NHC CPHC and JTWC as a storm that existed in all three areas of responsibility but isn t recognized by the JMA as a official western Pacific tropical cyclone 72 73 74 From Western Pacific to Central Pacific edit 1994 s Hurricane John crossed the dateline twice from the central to the western Pacific and back Tropical cyclones crossing from the western Pacific to the central Pacific are fairly rare and this has happened only seven times before Of those seven times five of them were storms which crossed the dateline twice from the western to the central pacific and back or vice versa No tropical cyclone from the western Pacific has ever made it past 140 W System crossed the dateline twice Hurricane Typhoon John formed in the eastern Pacific In addition Typhoon June of 1958 and Tropical Storm Wene of 2000 are recognized per CPHC as basin-crossing storms but aren t recognized as such by the JMA 81 82 Also Tropical Storm Moke of 1984 may have achieved this feat as well however it isn t recognized as an official western Pacific tropical cyclone by either the JMA or the JTWC 73 74 From Central Pacific to Eastern Pacific edit 2016 s Hurricane Ulika crossed 140 W thrice moving from the eastern to the central Pacific twice Tropical cyclones crossing from the eastern Pacific to the central Pacific are routine ones going the other way are not That event has happened thrice It was previously believed that an Unnamed Hurricane of 1975 crossed 140 W and is still included in the NHC as such but according to a reanalysis made by the CPHC the storm became extratropical before doing so 35 73 In addition an unofficial cyclone formed on October 30 2006 in the central Pacific subtropics It eventually developed an eye-like structure 85 Its track data indicates that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific because it formed at longitude 149 W and dissipated at 135 W 86 NASA which is not a meteorological organization called this system a subtropical cyclone and the Naval Research Laboratory Monterey had enough interest in it to call it 91C 85 The system has also been called extratropical 87 This cyclone is unofficial because it is not included in the seasonal reports of either Regional Specialized Meteorological Center 88 89 Intensity records edit Ten most intense edit Hurricane Patricia the most intense Pacific hurricane on record Per lowest central pressure edit The apparent increase in recent seasons is spurious it is due to better estimation and measurement not an increase in intense storms That is until 1988 Pacific hurricanes generally did not have their central pressures measured or estimated from satellite imagery Estimated from satellite imagery Pressure while East of the International Dateline Per highest sustained winds edit Strongest landfalls edit Hurricane Kenna of 2002 is the fourth strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record Strongest storm in each month edit Intensity is measured solely by central pressure unless the pressure is not known in which case intensity is measured by maximum sustained winds Unusual landfall locations edit California edit See also List of California hurricanes
