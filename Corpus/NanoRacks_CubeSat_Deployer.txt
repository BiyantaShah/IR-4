NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer NRCSD is a device to deploy CubeSats into orbit from the International Space Station Currently citation needed there are two CubeSat deployers on board the International Space Station ISS The Japanese Experiment Module JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer J-SSOD and the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer NRCSD The J-SSOD is the first of its kind to deploy small satellites from the International Space Station The NRCSD is the first commercially operated small satellite deployer from the ISS maximizing full capabilities of each airlock cycle clarification needed of deployments CubeSats belong to a class of research spacecraft called nanosatellites The basic cube-shaped satellites measure 10 centimeters 3.9 in on each side weigh less than 3 pounds 1.4 kg and have a volume of about 1 liter 0.22 imp gal 0.26 US gal although CubeSats are built and deployed that are multiples of 10 cm in length As of 2014 update one method of getting CubeSats to orbit is to transport them aboard a larger spacecraft as part of a cargo load to a larger space station When this is done deploying the CubeSats into orbit as a separate artificial satellite requires a special apparatus such as the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer The NRCSD is put into position to be grabbed by one of the ISS s robotic arms which then places the CubeSat deployer into the correct position externally mounted to the ISS to be able to release the miniature satellites into proper orbit Background edit The International Space Station was designed to be used as both a microgravity laboratory as well as a launch pad for low-Earth-orbit services The Japanese Space Agency s JAXA Kibo ISS module includes a small satellite-deployment system called the J-SSOD 1 NanoRacks via its Space Act Agreement with NASA deployed a CubeSat using the J-SSOD Seeing the emerging market demand for CubeSats NanoRacks self-funded its own ISS deployer with the permission of both NASA and JAXA NanoRacks evolved away from the J-SSOD due to the small number of satellites that could be deployed in one airlock cycle and their desire to maximize the capacity of each airlock cycle The J-SSOD used a full airlock cycle to only launch 6U The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer uses two airlock cycles each holding 8 deployers Each deployer is capable of holding 6U allowing a total of 48U per airlock cycle 2 non-primary source needed Deploying CubeSats from ISS has a number of benefits Launching the vehicles aboard the logistics carrier of ISS visiting vehicle reduces the vibration and loads they have to encounter during launch In addition they can be packed in protective materials so that the probability of CubeSat damage during launch is reduced significantly In addition for earth observation satellites such as those of Planet Labs the lower orbit of the ISS orbit at roughly 400 km is an advantage In addition the lower orbit allows a natural decay of the satellites thus reducing the build-up of orbital debris citation needed History edit JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer edit The Japanese Experiment Module Small Satellite Orbital Deployer J-SSOD is the first of its kind to deploy small satellites from the International Space Station The facility provides a unique satellite install case to the Japanese Experiment Module JEM Remote Manipulator System RMS for deploying small CubeSat satellites from the ISS 3 The J-SSOD holds up to 3 small one-unit 1U 10 x 10 x 10 centimeters small CubeSats per satellite install case 6 in total though other sizes up to 55 x 55 x 35 cm may also be used Each pre-packed satellite install case is loaded by crewmembers onto the Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform MPEP within the JEM habitable volume 3 The MPEP platform is then attached to the JEM Slide Table inside the JEM airlock for transfer to the JEMRMS and space environment The JEMRMS grapples and maneuvers the MPEP and J-SSOD to a predefined deployment orientation and then jettisons the small CubeSat satellites 3 The MPEP is a platform that acts as an interface between operations inside and outside the ISS and the J-SSOD mechanism is installed on this platform On July 21 2012 JAXA launched the Kounotori 3 HTV-3 cargo spacecraft to the ISS on Expedition 33 The J-SSOD was a payload on this flight along with five CubeSats that were planned to be deployed by the J-SSOD mounted on the JEMRMS JEM- Remote Manipulator System a robotic arm later in 2012 The five CubeSats were deployed successfully on Oct 4 2012 by the JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide using the newly installed J-SSOD This represented the first deployment service of J-SSOD 4 NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer Development edit In October 2013 NanoRacks became the first company to coordinate the deployment of small satellites CubeSats nanosatellites from the ISS via the airlock in the Japanese KIBO module This deployment was done by NanoRacks using J-SSOD NanoRacks first customer was FPT University of Hanoi Vietnam Their F-1 CubeSat was developed by young engineers and students at FSpace laboratory at FPT University of Hanoi The mission of F-1 was to survive the space environment for one month measuring temperature and magnetic data while taking low-resolution photos of Earth 5 In 2013 NanoRacks sought permission from NASA to develop their own hardware and CubeSat SmallSat deployer to use over the JEM- Small Satellite Deployer NanoRacks brought leadership to the American small satellite industry by building a larger deployer capable of deploying 48U of satellites NanoRacks designed manufactured and tested the deployer for NASA and JAXA approval to reach the International Space Station The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer was launched on January 9 2014 on the Orbital Sciences Orb-1 Cygnus Mission along with 33 small satellites 6 NRCSD technical details edit The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer NRCSD is a self-contained CubeSat deployer system that mechanically and electrically isolates CubeSats from the ISS cargo resupply vehicles and ISS crew The NRCSD design is compliant with NASA ISS flight safety requirements and is space-qualified 7 The NRCSD is a rectangular tube that consists of anodized aluminum plates base-plate assembly access panels and deployer doors The NRCSD deployer doors are located on the forward end the base-plate assembly is located on the aft end and access panels are provided on the top 7 The inside walls of the NRCSD are a smooth-bore design to minimize and or preclude hang-up or jamming of CubeSat appendages during deployment should these become released prematurely However deployable systems shall be designed such that there is no intentional contact with the inside walls of the NRCSD 7 For a deployment the platform is moved outside via the Kibo Module s Airlock and slide table that allows the JEMRMS to move the deployers to the correct orientation for the satellite release and also provides command and control to the deployers Each NRCSD NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer is capable of holding six CubeSat Units allowing it to launch two 3U satellites or a number of 2U and 1U satellites Manufacturing the NRCSD edit Quad-M Inc developed the CubeSat Deployer to be compliant with the Cal Poly standard It was redesigned and manufactured to NanoRacks specification for use on the International Space Station Quad-M performed an initial design analysis to ensure a compliant design The structural analysis included a modal analysis to evaluate vibration response and the thermal analysis included calculations to evaluate different door coating options and an initial transient thermal analysis to estimate In addition Quad-M performed development tests for the door release the CSD CubeSat Deployment test random vibration test and temperature cycling 8 Mission profile edit Integrating the CubeSats edit CubeSat integration begins with unpacking the CSD from the shipping container and then removing the Base Plate Assembly from the rear of the CSD Next the CubeSat is inserted from the rear and is slid up snug against the doors Additional CubeSats are then inserted from the rear in the same progress The Base Plate Assembly is then reinstalled Four jack screws are then adjusted with the Pusher Plate and locked The Containment Bolt is then removed and the deployer is packed for shipment Orbital
