Zvezda ISS module Zvezda heads into orbit aboard a Proton rocket on July 12 2000 Expedition 43 crew celebrate a birthday in Zvezda module 2015 Zvezda Russian meaning star DOS-8 also known as the Zvezda Service Module is a component of the International Space Station ISS It was the third module launched to the station and provides all of the station s life support systems some of which are supplemented in the USOS as well as living quarters for two crew members It is the structural and functional center of the Russian portion of the station - the Russian Orbital Segment The module was manufactured by RKK Energia with major sub-contracting work by GKNPTs Khrunichev 6 Zvezda was launched on a Proton rocket on July 12 2000 and docked with the Zarya module on July 26 Origins edit Main article Mir-2 The basic structural frame of Zvezda known as DOS-8 was initially built in the mid-1980s to be the core of the Mir-2 space station This means that Zvezda is similar in layout to the core module DOS-7 of the Mir space station It was in fact labeled as Mir-2 for quite some time in the factory Its design lineage thus extends back to the original Salyut stations The space frame was completed in February 1985 and major internal equipment was installed by October 1986 The MIR-2 space station was redesigned after the failure of the Polyus orbital weapons platform core module to reach orbit Zvezda is around 1 4 the size of Polyus and has no armaments Design edit Zvezda consists of the cylindrical Work Compartment where the crews work and live and which makes up the bulk of the modules volume the small spherical Transfer Compartment located at the front with three docking ports and at the aft end the cylindrical Transfer Chamber with one docking port which is surrounded by the unpressurized Assembly Compartment this gives Zvezda four docking ports in total 6 The component weighs about 18,051 kg 39,796 lb and had a length of 13.1 metres 43 ft The solar panels extend 29.7 metres 97 ft The Transfer Compartment attaches to the Zarya module and has docking ports intended for the Science Power Platform and the Universal Docking Module As in the early days of Mir the transfer compartment provides a suitable EVA airlock where spacewalkers in Orlan suits removed a hatch after closing a few that connected the compartment to the rest of the station It was used only during Expedition 2 where two men put a docking cone on the nadir port The lower port connects to Pirs and the top port connects to Poisk Eventually the plan for Pirs is for it to be deorbited and replaced by Nauka Multipurpose Laboratory Module Sprouts in the BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 Lada-2 Plants-2 experiment aboard Zvezda 7 The Assembly Compartment holds external equipment such as thrusters thermometers antennas and propellant tanks The Transfer Chamber is equipped with automatic docking equipment and is used to service Soyuz and Progress spacecraft Zvezda can support up to six crew 6 including separate sleeping quarters for two cosmonauts at a time 6 It also has a NASA-provided Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System and a bicycle for exercise a toilet and other hygiene facilities and a galley with a refrigerator and freezer The module contains the primary Russian computers for guidance and navigation Zvezda has 14 windows 6 There are two 9-inch-diameter 230 mm windows one in each of the two crew sleep compartments windows No 1 and 2 Six 9-inch-diameter 230 mm windows No 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 on the forward Transfer Compartment earth facing floor As well a 16-inch-diameter 410 mm window in the main Working Compartment No 9 and one 3-inch-diameter 76 mm window in the aft transfer compartment No 10 There are a further three 9-inch-diameter 230 mm windows in the forward end of the forward transfer compartment No 12 13 and 14 for observing approaching craft Note Window No 11 is unaccounted for in all available sources Zvezda also contains the Elektron system that electrolyzes condensed humidity and waste water to provide hydrogen and oxygen The hydrogen is expelled into space and the oxygen is used for breathing air The condensed water and the waste water can be used for drinking in an emergency but ordinarily fresh water from Earth is used There are 16 small thrusters and two large S5.79 thrusters for propulsion The oxidizer used for the propulsion system is dinitrogen tetroxide and the fuel is UDMH the supply tanks being pressurised with nitrogen 8 Additionally it has eight batteries for storing power The Elektron system has required significant maintenance work having failed several times and requiring the crew to use the Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator canisters also called Oxygen Candles which were the cause of a fire on Mir when it has been broken for extended amounts of time It also contains the Vozdukh a system which removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas Zvezda has been criticized for being excessively noisy and the crew has been observed wearing earplugs inside it Zvezda contains the ESA s Digital Management System a computer that controls ISS 9 Zvezda is also the home of the Lada Greenhouse which is a test for growing plants in space 10 Connection to the ISS edit Progress docked to Zvezda aft view The rocket used for launch to the ISS carried advertising it was emblazoned with the logo of Pizza Hut restaurants 11 12 13 for which they are reported to have paid more than US 1 million 14 The money helped support Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center and the Russian advertising agencies that orchestrated the event 15 On July 26 2000 Zvezda became the third component of the ISS when it docked at the aft port of Zarya Zarya had already been attached to the US Unity module Later in July the computers aboard Zarya handed over ISS commanding functions to computers on Zvezda 16 On September 11 2000 two members of the STS-106 Space Shuttle crew completed final connections between Zvezda and Zarya during a 6-hour 14 minute EVA astronaut Ed Lu and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko connected nine cables between Zvezda and Zarya including four power cables four video and data cables and a fiber-optic telemetry cable 17 The next day STS-106 crew members floated into Zvezda for the first time at 05 20 UTC on September 12 2000 18 Zvezda provided early living quarters a life support system a communication system Zvezda introduced a 10 Mbit s Ethernet network to the ISS 19 electrical power distribution a data processing system a flight control system and a propulsion system These quarters and some but not all systems have since been supplemented by additional ISS components The two main engines on Zvezda can be used to raise the station s altitude This was done on April 25 2007 This was the first time the engines had been fired since Zvezda arrived in 2000 20 Launch risks edit Due to Russian financial problems Zvezda was launched with no backup and no insurance Due to this risk NASA had constructed an Interim Control Module in case it was delayed significantly or destroyed on launch Interior edit Zvezda s
