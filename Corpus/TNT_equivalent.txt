TNT equivalent Kiloton redirects here For the similarly named weight measurements see Tonne Diagram of explosive yield vs mushroom cloud height illustrating the difference between 22 kiloton Fat Man and 15 megaton Castle Bravo explosions citation needed TNT equivalent is a convention for expressing energy typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion The ton of TNT is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184 gigajoules 1 which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton 1,000 kilograms or one megagram of TNT The convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which TNT is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energy Kiloton and megaton edit The kiloton of TNT is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 terajoules The megaton of TNT is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 petajoules The kiloton and megaton of TNT have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon The TNT equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impact 2 Historical derivation of the value edit A gram of TNT releases 2673 6702 J joules upon explosion 3 The energy liberated by one gram of TNT was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184 J 4 which is exactly one kilocalorie An explosive s energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation which for TNT has been accurately measured as 4686 J g from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853 J g 5 The measured pure heat output of a gram of TNT is only 2724 J 6 clarification needed but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculations Alternative TNT equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared 7 8 9 10 A kiloton of TNT can be visualized as a cube of TNT 8.46 metres 27.8 ft on a side Conversion to other units edit 1 ton TNT equivalent is approximately 1.0 109calories 4.184 109joules 3.96831 106British thermal units 3.08802 109foot pounds 1.162 103kilowatt hours Examples edit Further information Orders of magnitude energy Relative effectiveness factor edit The relative effectiveness factor RE factor relates an explosive s demolition power to that of TNT in units of the TNT equivalent kg TNTe kg The RE factor is the relative mass of TNT to which an explosive is equivalent The greater the RE the more powerful the explosive This enables engineers to determine the proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for TNT For example if a timber-cutting formula calls for a charge of 1 kg of TNT then based on octanitrocubane s RE factor of 2.38 it would take only 1.0 2.38 or 0.42 kg of it to do the same job Using PETN engineers would need 1.0 1.66 or 0.60 kg to obtain the same effects as 1 kg of TNT With ANFO or ammonium nitrate they would require 1.0 0.74 or 1.35 kg or 1.0 0.42 or 2.38 kg respectively RE factor examples edit TBX thermobaric explosives or EBX enhanced blast explosives in a small confined space may have over twice the power of destruction The total power of aluminized mixtures strictly depends on the condition of explosions Nuclear examples edit See also edit Nuclear weapon yield Nuclear arms race Orders of magnitude energy Relative effectiveness factor Ton Tonne Tonne of oil equivalent a unit of energy almost exactly 10 tonnes of TNT Table of explosive detonation velocities Brisance edit Thompson A Taylor BN July 2008 Guide for the Use of the International System of Units SI NIST Special Publication 811 National Institute of Standards and Technology Version 3.2 Nuclear Weapons FAQ Part 1.3 Rhodes Richard 2012 The Making of the Atomic Bomb 25th Anniversary ed Simon Schuster ISBN 978-1-4516-7761-4 Cooper Paul W 1996 Explosives Engineering New York Wiley-VCH ISBN 0-471-18636-8 HQ Department of the Army 2004 1967 Field Manual 5-25 Explosives and Demolitions Washington DC Pentagon Publishing pp 83 84 ISBN 0-9759009-5-1 Explosives - Compositions Alexandria VA GlobalSecurityorg retrieved September 1 2010 Urba ski Tadeusz 1985 1984 Chemistry and Technology of Explosives Volumes I IV second ed Oxford Pergamon J rg Mathieu and Hans Stucki 2004 International Standard Serial Number identifier ISSN 0009-4293 Military High Explosives CHIMIA EXPLOSIVES 58 No 6 ed Schweizerische Chemische Gesellschaft pp 383 389 3 Thermobaric Explosives Advanced Energetic Materials 2004 The National Academies Press napedu 2004
