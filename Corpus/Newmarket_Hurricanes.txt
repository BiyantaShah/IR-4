Newmarket Hurricanes The Newmarket Hurricanes are a Junior A ice hockey team from Newmarket Ontario They are a part of the Ontario Junior Hockey League History edit In 1972 the Seneca Flyers became a part of the OPJHL In 1975 they bought out the Newmarket Redmen of the Mid-Ontario Junior B Hockey League and moved to become the Newmarket Flyers The Redmen dated back to the 1950s and were at one point a top level Junior C team Although the official story is that the Hurricanes got their start in the late 1980s as the Newmarket 87 s the franchise that spawned this team existed long before it In 1986 the Newmarket Flyers folded The OHA Junior A league was on rocky footing in the late 1980s and was no longer cost efficient for most member teams Sensing the demise of the league the Flyers went on hiatus The league folded in 1987 their last champions happened to be the longtime Junior B team Owen Sound Greys As more Junior A teams had folded from the OHA-A the more Junior B teams came in to fill the void As the league ran almost completely out of original Junior A teams the league decided it would be best to fold The result was a mass expansion of local Junior B leagues filling with both still-active teams and teams that had folded due to problems in the OHA-A Newmarket pulled its franchise back together and joined the Central Junior B Hockey League as the 87 s After 1997 the 87 s became the Hurricanes The 87 s never did very well as a member of the Central B but no team exactly stacked up well to the powerhouse Barrie Colts who most notably pulled off an undefeated season in 1992-93 After the formation of the Ontario Provincial Junior A league in 1993 things started clicking for the franchise They have never ranked less than 10th in a 37 team league with 3 first place finishes in the regular season They have also pulled off three seasons with less than 10 losses in the OPJHL Their best season was the 1995-96 season after the Colts expanded into the Ontario Hockey League The 87 s finished in third place won the Buckland Cup as league champions and then took the Dudley Hewitt Cup as Central Canadian Junior A Champions At the inaugural Royal Bank Cup in 1996 at Melfort Saskatchewan the 87 s finished off in the round robin in second place with a 2-2 record They defeated the BCHL s Vernon Vipers 7-5 in their first game They then took out the SJHL s Yorkton Terriers 5-2 Everything was looking great but the 87 s soon fell apart In the third game the 87 s were up against the only other undefeated team the host the SJHL s Melfort Mustangs The Mustangs deflated the high-flying 87 s with an 11-3 blow-out Melfort finished perfect in the round robin but the 87 s were embarrassed again by the MJAHL s Moncton Beavers 4-3 The embarrassment was not due to the score but due to the Beavers standing as the only winless team left in the round robin until this point The Moncton victory still left them eliminated from the tournament Also due to a tie breaker the 87 s were still in second place They ended up playing the Vipers again in the semi-final and lost by an uninspired score of 7-4 The Vipers knocked off the undefeated Mustangs 2-0 in the final In the 2005-06 season the Hurricanes were excellent They finished 7th overall in the league and 2nd place in the North Division with 32 wins The Canes opened the playoffs with a 4 games to 1 series victory of the inconsistent Huntsville-Muskoka Otters The Canes ran into tho a brick wall the next round the division semi-final when they ran into a Stouffville Spirit squad that was firing on all cylinders The Spirit won the series in 6 games beat the Aurora Tigers for the division title in 6 games beat the Oakville Blades in 7 games in the Buckland Cup semi-final but were out-lasted by the defending champion St Michael s Buzzers 4 games to 2 in the league final On June 28 2008 the Newmarket Hurricanes lost a key part of their team Player KJ died as a passenger in a single car
