Extremophile Thermophiles a type of extremophile produce some of the bright colors of Grand Prismatic Spring Yellowstone National Park See also Earliest known life forms An extremophile from Latin extremus meaning extreme and Greek phili meaning love is an organism that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth 1 2 In contrast organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles Characteristics edit In the 1980s and 1990s biologists found that microbial life has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments niches that are acidic or extraordinarily hot for example that would be completely inhospitable to complex organisms Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far under the ocean s surface 3 According to astrophysicist Steinn Sigurdsson There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth and we know they re very hardened to radiation 4 On 6 February 2013 scientists reported that bacteria were found living in the cold and dark in a lake buried a half-mile deep under the ice in Antarctica 5 On 17 March 2013 researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive in the Marianas Trench the deepest place in Earth s oceans 6 7 Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 1,900 feet 580 m below the sea floor under 8,500 feet 2,600 m of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States 6 8 According to one of the researchers You can find microbes everywhere they re extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are 6 Morphology edit Most known extremophiles are microorganisms The domain Archaea contains renowned examples but extremophiles are present in numerous and diverse genetic lineages of bacteria and archaeans Furthermore it is erroneous to use the term extremophile to encompass all archaeans as some are mesophilic Neither are all extremophiles unicellular protostome animals found in similar environments include the Pompeii worm the psychrophilic Grylloblattidae insects and Antarctic krill a crustacean Many would also classify tardigrades water bears as extremophiles but while tardigrades can survive in extreme environments they are not considered extremophiles because they are not adapted to live in these conditions Their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environment Classifications edit There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions These classifications are not exclusive Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as polyextremophiles For example organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth s surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as Thermococcus barophilus 10 A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the Atacama Desert might be a radioresistant xerophile a psychrophile and an oligotroph Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low pH levels 11 Terms edit Acidophile An organism with optimal growth at pH levels of 3 or below Alkaliphile An organism with optimal growth at pH levels of 9 or above Anaerobe An organism that does not require oxygen for growth such as Spinoloricus cinzia Two sub-types exist facultative anaerobe and obligate anaerobe A facultative anaerobe can tolerate anaerobic and aerobic conditions however an obligate anaerobe would die in the presence of even trace levels of oxygen Cryptoendolith An organism that lives in microscopic spaces within rocks such as pores between aggregate grains these may also be called endolith a term that also includes organisms populating fissures aquifers and faults filled with groundwater in the deep subsurface Halophile An organism requiring at least 0.2M concentrations of salt NaCl for growth 12 Hyperthermophile An organism that can thrive at temperatures above 80 C such as those found in hydrothermal systems Hypolith An organism that lives underneath rocks in cold deserts Lithoautotroph An organism usually bacteria whose sole source of carbon is carbon dioxide and exergonic inorganic oxidation chemolithotrophs such as Nitrosomonas europaea these organisms are capable of deriving energy from reduced mineral compounds like pyrites and are active in geochemical cycling and the weathering of parent bedrock to form soil Metallotolerant Capable of tolerating high levels of dissolved heavy metals in solution such as copper cadmium arsenic and zinc examples include Ferroplasma sp Cupriavidus metallidurans and GFAJ-1 13 14 15 Oligotroph An organism capable of growth in nutritionally limited environments Osmophile An organism capable of growth in environments with a high sugar concentration Piezophile Also referred to as barophile An organism that lives optimally at high pressures such as those deep in the ocean or underground 16 common in the deep terrestrial subsurface as well as in oceanic trenches Polyextremophile A polyextremophile faux Ancient Latin Greek for affection for many extremes is an organism that qualifies as an extremophile under more than one category Psychrophile Cryophile An organism capable of survival growth or reproduction at temperatures of -15 C or lower for extended periods common in cold soils permafrost polar ice cold ocean water and in or under alpine snowpack Radioresistant Organisms resistant to high levels of ionizing radiation most commonly ultraviolet radiation but also including organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation Thermophile An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 45 122 C Thermoacidophile Combination of thermophile and acidophile that prefer temperatures of 70 80 C and pH between 2 and 3 Xerophile An organism that can grow in extremely dry desiccating conditions this type is exemplified by the soil microbes of the Atacama Desert In astrobiology edit Astrobiology is the field concerned with forming theories such as panspermia about the distribution nature and future of life in the universe In it microbial ecologists astronomers planetary scientists geochemists philosophers and explorers cooperate constructively to guide the search for life on other planets Astrobiologists are particularly interested in studying extremophiles 17 as many organisms of this type are capable of surviving in environments similar to those known to exist on other planets For example Mars may have regions in its deep subsurface permafrost that could harbor endolith communities 17 The subsurface water ocean of Jupiter s moon Europa may harbor life especially at hypothesized hydrothermal vents at the ocean floor Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including Escherichia coli and Paracoccus denitrificans being subject to conditions of extreme gravity The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 g ie 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth Paracoccus denitrificans was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful growth under hypergravity The research has implications on the feasibility of panspermia 18 19 On 26 April 2012 scientists reported that lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under Martian conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory MSL maintained by the German Aerospace Center DLR 20 21 On 29 April 2013 scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute funded by NASA reported that during spaceflight on the International Space Station microbes seem to adapt to the space environment in ways not observed on Earth and in ways that can lead to increases in growth and virulence 22 On 19 May 2014 scientists announced that numerous microbes like Tersicoccus phoenicis may be resistant to methods usually used in spacecraft assembly clean rooms It s not currently known if such resistant microbes could have withstood space travel and are present on the Curiosity rover now on the planet Mars 23 On 20 August 2014 scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living half a mile below the ice of Antarctica 24 25 Examples edit New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing For example microbial life lives in the liquid asphalt lake Pitch Lake Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 106 to 107 cells gram 26 27 Likewise until recently boron tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria With the recent isolation of Bacillus boroniphilus borophiles came into discussion 28 Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency Industrial uses edit The thermoalkaliphilic catalase which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water was isolated from an organism Thermus brockianus found in Yellowstone National Park by Idaho National Laboratory researchers The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30 C to over 94 C and a pH range from 6 10 This catalase is extremely stable compared to other catalases at high temperatures and pH In a comparative study the T brockianus catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80 C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from Aspergillus niger had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching textile bleaching food pasteurization and surface decontamination of food packaging 29 DNA modifying enzymes such as Taq DNA polymerase and some Bacillus enzymes used in clinical diagnostics and starch liquefaction are produced commercially by several biotechnology companies 30 DNA transfer edit Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell s chromosome 31 Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer as described below However it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is one of the most radioresistant organisms known This bacterium can also survive cold dehydration vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile D radiodurans is competent to perform genetic transformation 32 Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated The extreme thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus and other related Thermus species are also capable of genetic transformation 33 Halobacterium volcanii an extreme halophilic saline tolerant archaeon is capable of natural genetic transformation Cytoplasmic bridges are formed between cells that appear to be used for DNA transfer from one cell to another in either direction 34 Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are hyperthermophilic archaea Exposure of these organisms to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation bleomycin or mitomycin C induces species-specific cellular aggregation 35 36 UV-induced cellular aggregation of S acidocaldarius mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency 36 Recombination rates exceed those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude Frols et al 35 and Ajon et al 36 hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to repair damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination Van Wolferen et al 37 noted that this DNA exchange process may be crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperatures It has also been suggested that DNA transfer in Sulfolobus may be an early form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that involve species-specific DNA transfer leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage 38 and see Transformation genetics Extracellular membrane vesicles MVs might be involved in DNA transfer between different hyperthermophilic archaeal species 39 It has been shown that both plasmids 40 and viral genomes 39 can be transferred via MVs Notably a horizontal plasmid transfer has been documented between hyperthermophilic Thermococcus and Methanocaldococcus species respectively belonging to the orders Thermococcales and Methanococcales 41 See also edit Deinococcus
