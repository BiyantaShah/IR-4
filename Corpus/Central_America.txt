Central America Not to be confused with Central United States Central America Spanish Am rica Central or Centroam rica is the southernmost isthmian portion of the North American continent which connects with the South American continent on the southeast Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north Colombia to the southeast the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west Central America consists of seven countries Belize Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Nicaragua and Panama The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 2009 estimate 2 and 42,688,190 2012 estimate 3 Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property In the Pre-Columbian era Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east Soon after Christopher Columbus s voyages to the Americas the Spanish began to colonize the Americas From 1609 until 1821 most of the territory within Central America except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama was governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821 some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America which lasted from 1823 to 1838 The seven states finally became independent autonomous states beginning with Nicaragua Honduras Costa Rica and Guatemala 1838 followed by El Salvador 1841 then Panama 1903 and finally Belize 1981 Even today though people in Central America sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a Central American state eg it is still common to write CA after the country names in formal and informal contexts Different definitions edit Central America may mean different things to various people based upon different contexts The United Nations geoscheme for the Americas defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States and specifically includes all of Mexico 4 Middle America is usually thought to comprise Mexico to the north of the 7 states of Central America as well as Colombia and Venezuela to the south Usually the whole of the Caribbean to the north-east and sometimes the Guyanas are also included According to one source the term Central America was used as a synonym for Middle America at least as recently as 1962 5 In Ibero-America Latin America and Iberia the Americas is considered a single continent and Central America is considered a subcontinent separate from North America comprising the seven countries south of Mexico and north of Colombia 6 In Brazil Central America comprises all countries between Mexico and Colombia including those in the Caribbean Mexico in whole or in part is sometimes included by British people 7 8 9 not in citation given 10 For the people living in the five countries formerly part of the Federal Republic of Central America there is a distinction between the Spanish language terms Am rica Central and Centroam rica While both can be translated into English as Central America Am rica Central is generally used to refer to the geographical area of the seven countries between Mexico and Colombia while Centroam rica is used when referring to the former members of the Federation emphasizing the shared culture and history of the region History edit Main article History of Central America Central America 1798 Tikal Guatemala Tazumal El Salvador Copan Honduras Altun Ha Belize Stone spheres of Costa Rica Ancient footprints of Acahualinca Nicaragua In the Pre-Columbian era the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica Most notable among these were the Mayans who had built numerous cities throughout the region and the Aztecs who had created a vast empire The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador eastern Honduras Caribbean Nicaragua most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some 11 culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area Following Christopher Columbus s voyages to the Americas the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523 Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523 Alvarado s forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms including the K iche Tz utujil Pipil and the Kaqchikel By 1528 the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete with only the Pet n Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence The last independent Maya kingdoms the Kowoj and the Itza people were finally defeated in 1697 as part of the Spanish conquest of Pet n citation needed In 1538 Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca This entity was dissolved in 1543 and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real de Guatemala This area included the current territories of Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Nicaragua and the Mexican state of Chiapas but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama The president of the Audiencia which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala was the governor of the entire area In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821 with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of C rdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821 From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823 the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823 Central America again became independent On 1 July 1823 the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America citation needed The Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Los Altos Mosquito Coast and Nicaragua The lowlands of southwest Chiapas including Soconusco initially belonged to the Republic until 1824 when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838 when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars citation needed The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence see History of Belize 1506 1862 Spain and later Guatemala considered this land a Guatemalan department In 1862 Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras It became independent as Belize in 1981 citation needed Panama situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama Beginning in 1543 Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru along with all other Spanish possessions in South America Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739 when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada the capital of which was located at Santa F de Bogot Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819 A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822 the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830 Panama became part of a successor state the Republic of New Granada From 1855 until 1886 Panama existed as Panama State first within the Republic of New Granada then within the Granadine Confederation and finally within the United States of Colombia The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886 As part of the Republic of Colombia Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department Despite the many political reorganizations Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903 Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity citation needed By the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase Banana Republic 12 After more than two hundred years of social unrest violent conflict and revolution Central America today remains in a period of

Cordillera de Talamanca At 4,220 meters 13,850 ft Volc n Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below High points in Central America Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee tobacco beans and other crops Most of the population of Honduras Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys 15 Trade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season and are lowest during the winter dry season when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate The highest temperatures occur in April due to higher levels of sunlight lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds 16 Biodiversity edit See also Central America bioregion El Chorreron in El Salvador Central America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot boasting 7 of the world s biodiversity 17 The Pacific Flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America especially in the spring and autumn As a bridge between North America and South America Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropic ecozones However the southern countries Costa Rica and Panama of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries Guatemala and Belize meanwhile the central countries Honduras Nicaragua and El Salvador have the least biodiversity 17 The table below shows recent statistics Biodiversity in Central America number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants Over 300 species of the region s flora and fauna are threatened 107 of which are classified as critically endangered The underlying problems are deforestation which is estimated by FAO at 1.2 per year in Central America and Mexico combined fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80 of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture 25 Efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves 36 of Belize s land territory falls under some form of official protected status giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas In addition 13 of Belize s marine territory are also protected 26 A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world It is home to 70 hard coral species 36 soft coral species 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species So far only about 10 of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered 27 Flora edit One of the hanging bridges of the skywalk at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Monteverde Costa Rica disappearing into the clouds From 2001 to 2010 5,376 square kilometers 2,076 sq mi of forest were lost in the region In 2010 Belize had 63 of remaining forest cover Costa Rica 46 Panama 45 Honduras 41 Guatemala 37 Nicaragua 29 and El Salvador 21 Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome with 12,201 square kilometers 4,711 sq mi Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers 1,830 sq mi and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers 793 sq mi Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1 to the loss in forest vegetation The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers 3,310 sq mi of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010 The most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers 1,180 sq mi of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras 28 The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome is found in Central America and southern Mexico The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of 111,400 square kilometers 43,000 sq mi 29 extending along the mountainous spine of Central America extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico s Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras to central Nicaragua The pine-oak forests lie between 600 1,800 metres 2,000 5,900 ft elevation 29 and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests Higher elevations above 1,800 metres 5,900 ft are usually covered with Central American montane forests The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak pine fir and cypress Laurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest found in almost all Central American countries normally more than 1,000 meters 3,300 ft above sea level Tree species include evergreen oaks members of the laurel family and species of Weinmannia Drimys and Magnolia 30 The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas Guatemala is the largest in Central America In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests the largest located near the border with Nicaragua In Nicaragua cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras but many were cleared to grow coffee There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua In Costa Rica there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilar n and Volc n Arenal called Monteverde also in the Cordillera de Talamanca The Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome as defined by the World Wildlife Fund 31 These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800 4,000 metres 5,900 13,100 ft on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico through Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras to northern Nicaragua The entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers 5,100 sq mi and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels 31 Fauna edit See also List of Central American mammals and List of Central American monkey species Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region Several birds are listed as threatened most notably the resplendent quetzal Pharomacrus mocinno three-wattled bellbird Procnias tricarunculata bare-necked umbrellabird Cephalopterus glabricollis and black guan Chamaepetes unicolor Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve which is part of the Talamancan montane forests has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN The exact causes for its extincition are unknown Global warming may have played a role because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region Jaguars cougars spider monkeys as well as tapirs and anteaters live in the woods of Central America 30 The Central American red

frequently and tsunamis occurring occasionally Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters Most of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos Nazca and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench a major subduction zone The Middle America Trench is situated some 60 160 kilometers 37 99 mi off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench 32 For example subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902 1942 1956 1982 1992 2001 2007 2012 2014 and many other earthquakes throughout Central America The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico near Acapulco Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717 1773 1902 1976 1980 and 2009 Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault which runs parallel to and roughly 80 kilometers 50 mi to the north of the Motagua Fault Though less active than the Motagua Fault seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala 33 Managua the capital of Nicaragua was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972 Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America In 1968 the Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris Fertile soils from weathered

integration process continued with the signature of the San Salvador Treaty which created the ODECA the Organization of Central American States However the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states In 1991 the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the Central American Integration System Sistema para la Integraci n Centroamericana or SICA SICA
