Fire whirl A fire whirl with flames in the vortex A fire whirl also commonly known as a fire devil or in many cases erroneously as a fire tornado firenado or fire twister is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash They usually start with a whirl of wind or smoke Fire whirls may occur when intense rising heat and turbulent wind conditions combine to form whirling eddies of air These eddies can contract into a tornado-like vortex that sucks in burning debris and combustible gases Fire whirls are sometimes colloquially called fire tornadoes but are not usually classifiable as tornadoes as the vortex in most cases does not extend from the surface to cloud base Also even in such cases even those fire whirls are not classic tornadoes in that their vorticity derives from surface winds and heat-induced lifting rather than a tornadic mesocyclone aloft The literal fire tornado is a rare phenomenon much more powerful and destructive than the a typical fire whirl in which the wildfire generates a pyrocumulonimbus cloud that then spawns a tornado When this tornado forms in or enters the fire zone it fans flames enormously draws flame and burning debris into itself and scatters burning debris over a wide area Formation edit A fire whirl consists of a burning core and an rotating pocket of air A fire whirl can reach up to 2,000 F 1,090 C 1 Often fire whirls are created when a wildfire or firestorm creates its own wind which can turn into a vortex of fire This causes the tall and skinny appearance of a fire whirl s core Most of the largest fire whirls are spawned from wildfires They form when a warm updraft and convergence from the wildfire are present 2 They are usually 10-50 meters tall a few meters wide and last only a few minutes However some can be more than a kilometer tall contain winds over 160 km h and persist for more than 20 minutes 3 Fire whirls can uproot trees up to 15 metres 49 ft tall 4 These can also aid the spotting ability of wildfires to propagate and start new fires as they lift burning materials such as tree bark These burning embers can be blown away from the fireground by the stronger winds aloft Examples edit Another fire whirl An extreme example of a fire tornado is the 1923 Great Kant earthquake in Japan which ignited a large city-sized firestorm and produced a gigantic fire whirl that killed 38,000 people in fifteen minutes in the Hifukusho-Ato region of Tokyo 5 Another example is the numerous large fire whirls some tornadic that developed after lightning struck an oil storage facility near San Luis Obispo California on 7 April 1926 several of which produced significant structural damage well away from the fire killing two Many whirlwinds were produced by the four-day-long firestorm coincident with conditions that produced severe thunderstorms in which the larger fire whirls carried debris 5 kilometers away 6 A fire whirl of reportedly uncommon size for New Zealand wildfires formed on day three of the 2017 Port Hills fires in Christchurch Pilots estimated the fire column to be 100 metres 330 ft high 7 Classification edit There are currently three known types of fire whirls 8 Type 1 Stable and centered over burning area Type 2 Stable or transient downwind of burning area Type 3 Steady or transient centered over an open area adjacent to an asymmetric burning area with wind There is evidence suggesting that the fire whirl in the Hifukusho-ato area during the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 was of type 3 9 edit Notes edit Bibliography edit Church Christopher R John T Snow Jean Dessens 1980 Intense Atmospheric Vortices Associated with a 1000 MW Fire Bull Am Meteorol Soc 61 7 682 94 Bibcode 1980BAMS61682C doi 10.1175 1520-0477 1980 061 0682 IAVAWA 2.0CO 2 edit photo fire whirl outback Australia New Elizabeth 1 November 2012 Fire tornadoes a rare weather phenomenon Australian Geographic Retrieved 6 March 2017 Fire tornado video whirl 11 September 2012 Alice Springs Australia Photo wwwabcnetau news Australian researchers document world-first fire tornado Catalyst story Fire Tornado Another photo wwwyoutubecom Video of a Fire whirl 0 30 Brazil Rare Footage of Fire Tornado BBC 25 August 2010 Video of a Fire Tornado in San Diego country Fire Whirl Simulations
