Progress spacecraft The Progress Russian is a Russian expendable cargo spacecraft Its purpose is to deliver supplies needed to sustain human presence in orbit While it does not carry a crew it can be boarded by astronauts when docked with a space station hence it being classified as manned by its manufacturer 1 2 3 Progress is derived from the manned Soyuz spacecraft and launches on the same vehicle a Soyuz rocket Progress has supported space stations as early as Salyut 6 and as recently as the International Space Station Each year there are between three and four Progress flights to the ISS A Progress remains docked until shortly before being replaced with a new one or a Soyuz which will use the same docking port Then it is filled with waste disconnected and de-orbited at which point it burns up in the atmosphere Due to the variation in Progress vehicles flown to the ISS NASA uses its own nomenclature where ISS 1P means the first Progress spacecraft to ISS Progress was developed because of the need for a constant source of supplies to make long duration space missions possible It was determined that cosmonauts needed an inflow of consumables food water air etc plus there was a need for maintenance items and scientific payloads that necessitated a dedicated cargo carrier Such payloads were impractical to launch with passengers in the restricted space of a Soyuz As of December 1 2016 there have been 155 Progress flights with three failures All three failures have occurred since 2011 Design edit Diagram of the Progress-M spacecraft Progress is of much the same size and shape as Soyuz It consists of three modules A pressurized forward module This carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment clothes prepackaged and fresh food and letters from home The docking drogue is similar to that of the Soyuz but features ducting for the UDMH fuel and N2O4 oxidiser A fuel compartment The reentry module of the Soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft This meant that if a leak occurred the poisonous gas would not enter the station s atmosphere The fuel is carried in two tanks A propulsion module The propulsion module at the rear of the spacecraft remained unchanged and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking It may be used to boost the orbit of the station once docked Reduction in mass was possible because the Progress was designed to be unmanned and disposable This means that there is no need for bulky life support systems and heat shields A small amount of weight is saved due to the lack of automatic rescue crews system and lack of parachutes The spacecraft also has no ability to split into separate modules After undocking the spacecraft performs a retrofire and burns up in the atmosphere Versions edit There were many small variations between the different flights but the major upgrades are reflected in the change of name Progress 1978 1990 edit Main article Progress 7K-TG Progress logistics resupply spacecraft It consists of the dry cargo module left the tanker compartment center and a stretched service module right There were 42 spacecraft built using the initial Progress design the last one being launched in May 1990 The bureau in charge of designing the freighter was TsKBEM now RKK Energia They began work on the design in mid-1973 assigning Progress the GRAU index 11F615A15 The design was complete by February 1974 and the first production model was ready for launch in November 1977 Progress 1 launched on 20 January 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the Soyuz It still featured the same launch shroud as the Soyuz though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the launch escape system had been deactivated This first version of Progress had a mass of 7,020 kg and carried 2,300 kg of cargo or 30 of its launch mass It had the same diameter as the Soyuz at 2.2 metres but was 8 metres in length slightly longer The autonomous flight time was 3 days the same time as that of the Soyuz ferry It could spend one month docked Progress always docked to the aft port of the station it was resupplying the aft being where the main rocket engines of the station and their tankage for refueling by the Progress are located Launch mass 7,020 7,249 kg Mass of cargo 2,300 kg before Progress-24 2,500 kg from Progress-24 Length 7.94 m Diameter of cargo modules 2.2 m Maximum diameter 2.72 m Volume of cargo compartment 6.6 m Progress-M 11F615A55 1989-2009 edit Main article Progress-M Progress-M logistics resupply spacecraft The upgraded Progress M GRAU 11F615A55 manufacturer s designation 7K-TGM was first launched in August 1989 The first 43 flights all went to Mir following Mir s re-entry Progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the International Space Station As of August 2014 there have been 56 flights to the ISS and more are scheduled 4 The Progress M is essentially the same spacecraft as the Progress but it features improvements based on the Soyuz T and TM designs It can spend up to 30 days in autonomous flight and is able to carry 100 kg more Also unlike the old Progress crafts it can return items to Earth This is accomplished by using the Raduga capsule which can carry up to 150 kg of cargo It is 1.5 m long and 60 cm in diameter and has a dry mass of 350 kg Progress M can also dock to the forward port of the station and still transfer fuel It uses the same rendezvous system as the Soyuz and it features solar panels for the first time Launch mass 7,130 kg Cargo mass 2,600 kg Dry cargo mass 1,500 kg Liquid cargo mass 1,540 kg Length 7.23 m Diameter of cargo modules 2.2 m Maximum diameter 2.72 m Dry cargo compartment volume 7.6 m Solar array span 10.6 m Progress- 11F615A60 2008-2015 edit Main article Progress-M A new modification of the Progress spacecraft with new TsVM-101 digital flight computer and MBITS digital telemetry system 5 was first launched on 26 November 2008 at 12 38 UTC from the Kazakhstan s Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket The first spacecraft of this series was Progress M-01M The spacecraft belongs to the so-called 400 series GRAU 11F615A60 and all modifications applied to it were subsequently used in the production of new Soyuz-TMA-M 6 manned spacecraft Progress M-27M was launched on April 28 2015 but communication with the vessel was lost soon after and it was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere on 8 May 2015 7 The last launch was Progress M-29M Progress M1 2000-2004 edit Main article Progress-M1 Progress M1 is another variant capable of carrying more propellant but less total cargo to the space stations There have been 11 of these flights Mass 7,150 kg Capacity cargo 2,230 kg Capacity dry cargo 1,800 kg Capacity propellant 1,950 kg Progress M2 edit Progress M2 was a planned variant which was a proposed design for the proposed Mir-2 space station but was dropped due to financial issues The M2 variant would have a larger service module for larger cargo or space station modules and would have been launched on a Zenit rocket as the spacecraft is bigger Progress MS 2015-present edit Progress MS is an improved variant which first launched on 21 December 2015 8 It has the following improvements 9 New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers First time installed on Progress MS 3 Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism Improved MMOD protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System UCTS Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system Current status edit Launch of Progress M-11M Progress M1-3 seen docked at the bottom of the Zvezda module of the ISS during STS-106 Progress spacecraft are currently used to resupply the International Space Station ISS Between 1 February 2003 and 26 July 2005 they were the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station as the Space Shuttle fleet was grounded after the breakup of Columbia at the end of STS-107 For ISS missions the Progress M1 variant is used which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section and as a result is able to carry more propellant citation needed Progress M-67 the final flight of a Progress-M spacecraft was launched 24 July 2009 on a Soyuz-U The European Space Agency ESA operated its own type of robotic supply freighter the Automated Transfer Vehicle ATV The first of these named Jules Verne was launched at 04 03 GMT on 9 March 2008 ATVs can carry up to 8.85 tonnes of cargo into space roughly three times as much as the Progress and were launched annually by Ariane 5 rockets from 2011-2014 as part of ESA contribution to ISS upkeep The design is currently being adopted as the Service Module of the NASA Orion spacecraft NASA s Orion spacecraft which will replace the Space Shuttle was initially designed to have an unmanned variant of the Crew Module similar to Progress however this capability has since when been removed 10 SpaceX s commercial private owned Dragon spacecraft and Orbital Sciences Cygnus spacecraft also handle American logistics to the International Space Station RKK Energia has proposed the Parom ferry spacecraft as a replacement for Progress This new spacecraft would retrieve either the proposed Kliper spacecraft or any cargo container with a Russian airlock and weighing up to 15 short tons 14 t back to the ISS citation needed See also edit Spaceflight portal List of Progress flights List of unmanned spaceflights to the ISS Comparison of orbital spacecraft Unmanned
