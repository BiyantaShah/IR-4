Hurricane Ophelia 2017 Hurricane Ophelia known as Storm Ophelia in Ireland and the United Kingdom while extratropical was the easternmost Atlantic major hurricane on record The tenth consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season Ophelia had non-tropical origins from a decaying cold front on 6 October Located within a favorable environment the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11 October After becoming a Category 2 hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day Ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14 October south of the Azores brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall Shortly after achieving peak intensity Ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards Ireland and Great Britain Completing an extratropical transition early on 16 October Ophelia became the second storm of the 2017 18 UK and Ireland windstorm season Early on 17 October the cyclone crossed the North Sea and struck western Norway with wind gusts up to 70 kilometres per hour 43 mph in Rogaland county before weakening during the evening The system made additional landfalls in Sweden and Finland before dissipating over Russia Five deaths can be attributed to Ophelia all of which occurred in Ireland The total losses from the storm are estimated at 1 billion US 1.18 billion mostly from economic losses insured damage claims as of 24 October reached 6 million US 7 million in Ireland and 5 10 million US 6.6 13.2 million in the United Kingdom Meteorological history edit Map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the Saffir Simpson scale On 6 October the United States National Hurricane Center NHC began monitoring the tail end of a decaying cold front for possible subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis 1 On the same day a circulation developed on the periphery of this front 1 Soon afterwards a non-tropical low developed within the circulation and drifted to the southwest before becoming nearly stationary 2 The system began to acquire subtropical characteristics on the next day and the chances of development were raised to a high percentage of cyclogenesis 3 After a brief loss of organization and diminished convection due to moderate wind shear 4 the system continued to steadily organize and developed a well-defined circulation center early on 9 October as deep convection began to persist near the center 5 By 09 00 UTC that day the convection had persisted long enough for the system to be classified as a tropical depression about 875 mi 1,410 km west-southwest of the Azores and the storm was identified as Tropical Depression Seventeen 6 7 A curved banding feature wrapped around the center as the satellite presentation improved leading to the upgrade to Tropical Storm Ophelia six hours later 8 Tropical Depression Seventeen organizing in the Atlantic Ocean on 9 October Despite marginally warm sea surface temperatures of around 79 F 26 C the effects of below-average temperatures aloft and low wind shear allowed Ophelia to gradually strengthen with banding features becoming more prominent as it drifted northwards in an area of weak steering currents 9 In addition the large temperature contrast between the ocean surface and extremely cold temperatures in the upper atmosphere allowed the storm to continue strengthening despite it being over normally suboptimal ocean temperatures 10 A slight degradation of the structure of the storm resulted in some weakening early on 11 October 11 but this was short-lived as deep convection wrapped around the entire storm It was upgraded to a hurricane at 21 00 UTC that day after a ragged eye developed becoming the record-tying tenth consecutive hurricane to form during the 2017 hurricane season Ophelia was the fourth such occurrence since the 1878 1886 and 1893 seasons 12 13 nb 1 Afterwards Ophelia steadily intensified as it became nearly stationary intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale on 12 October as the central dense overcast became more symmetric and the eye became better defined 14 The hurricane then weakened slightly the on next day as cloud tops warmed 15 only to quickly strengthen as the eye became much more defined and cloud tops cooled significantly due to outflow from a strong trough to the northeast The NHC upgraded the storm to a major hurricane Category 3 or higher at 15 00 UTC on 14 October the farthest east that a storm of such intensity had been observed in the satellite era 16 17 At the same time it attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph 185 km h and a minimum pressure of 960 millibars 28.35 inHg while located approximately 235 miles 375 km southeast of the Azores After peaking in intensity increasing shear and dry air from an encroaching frontal boundary began to disrupt the core of the storm which caused Ophelia to begin weakening early on 15 October as it began its extratropical transition with the eye collapsing 18 The process accelerated as Ophelia became further embedded in the trough and ultimately the storm became extratropical at 03 00 UTC on the next day 19 Preparations and impact edit Azores edit The Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere issued a red warning for heavy rainfall for the eastern group of the Azores S o Miguel Santa Maria and Formigas on 14 October from 17 59 UTC to 23 59 UTC 20 An orange gale warning was issued for the eastern group for the afternoon through night of 14 15 October 20 as well as a yellow alert for high seas 20 Rainfall alerts were also issued for the central group Terceira Graciosa S o Jorge Island Pico and Faial The President of the Regional Service of Civil Protection of the Azores Lieutnant-Colonel Carlos Neves announced there was no serious damage High winds downed four trees on S o Miguel three in the Ponta Delgada district and one in Povoa o The island also experienced some minor flooding In the central group of the Azores there were a few instances of light damage with one home suffering a roof leak 21 Iberia edit Satellite image depicting smoke from wildfires in northern Portugal and northwestern Spain on 15 October ahead of Hurricane Ophelia Main article October 2017 Iberian wildfires Starting on 15 October 2017 winds from Hurricane Ophelia fanned wildfires in both Portugal and Spain The wildfires have claimed the lives of at least 49 individuals including 45 in Portugal and four in Spain and dozens more were injured 22 23 24 25 26 In Portugal more than 4,000 firefighters are battling around 150 fires 27 Republic of Ireland edit Ophelia making landfall in Ireland as an extratropical cyclone on 16 October Met ireann Ireland s national meteorological service reported on 12 October that the storm would reach Ireland On 14 October it issued a Status Red warning its highest storm category 28 for portions of Ireland 29 30 Issuing such a warning more than 48 hours in advance was unprecedented as such warnings are normally issued within 24 hours of the event 31 On 15 October the National Emergency Coordination Centre and Met ireann convened to advise the public in relation to the post-tropical storm reaching the Republic of Ireland At 20 15 on the 15th status red was extended to all of Ireland 31 and all public education services were confirmed as cancelled 32 The Department of Education and Skills confirmed that all Montessoris creches primary and post-primary schools would be closed on 16 and 17 October 33 34 Other public services would be withdrawn such as Court and District Court services third-level institutes such as UCC CIT University of Limerick and Waterford Institute of Technology 35 Aer Lingus confirmed a number of flights from Cork Airport and Shannon Airport would be cancelled with the likelihood of 50 flights being cancelled 36 All public transport previously scheduled within the red alert zone were cancelled including bus rail and ferry journeys Bus ireann announced the cancellation of school bus services for the west of Ireland after Met ireann issued a rare Status Red warning affecting the south western and western counties of Wexford Waterford Cork Kerry Clare Mayo and Galway 37 The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government confirmed members of the public should not make any unnecessary journeys especially travelling within the red level warning areas and the department reiterated the storm is potential risk to life 38 On 16 October gusts of up to 191 kilometres per hour 119 mph were recorded at Fastnet Rock off the coast of County Cork the highest wind speeds ever recorded in Ireland 10-minute sustained wind speeds at Roches Point Co Cork reached 111 kilometres per hour 69 mph with gusts of 156 kilometres per hour 97 mph 39 ESB Group confirmed that more than 360,000 customers were without power in the wake of the storm 40 41 Two people a man in Dundalk and a woman in Aglish County Waterford were killed when trees fell on their cars 42 43 In County Tipperary another fatality occurred when a man was clearing a fallen tree with a chainsaw 44 Two men died in separate incidents after suffering fatal injuries while carrying out repairs to damage caused by Ophelia and Storm Brian In Cork a man died after he fell while working on a shed roof and in County Wicklow another man died after falling from a ladder while carrying out repairs to his farm shed 45 On 17 October it was estimated that Ophelia had caused 1 billion 1.18 billion USD losses in Ireland for the most part for the shutdown of economic activities the day of its passage 46 As of 24 October insurance claims across Ireland reached 6 million US 7 million primarily coming from residents in Cork and Tipperary 47 Insured damage is not expected to exceed that of Storm Darwin in 2014 which resulted in 111 million US 131 million in payouts 48 United Kingdom edit Saharan dust and smoke brought north by the former hurricane created hazy skies across parts of the United Kingdom on 16 October resulting in an orange or red sun The Met Office in the United Kingdom issued the first severe weather warnings for Ophelia on 12 October referring to the hurricane as ex-Ophelia in the context of the 2017 18 UK and Ireland windstorm season 49 The severe weather warning initially issued on 12 October was a yellow weather warning for wind covering Northern Ireland northern England Wales south west England and southern and western Scotland valid between 12 00 and 23 55 BST on 15 October 49 The weather warning impact matrix warned of relatively severe impacts anticipated although with a low level of certainty so far in advance preventing the issuance of amber weather warnings initially 49 Subsequently on 13 October a yellow severe weather warning for wind was issued for Northern Ireland southern Scotland and northern England valid between 00 05 and 15 00 BST on 17 October On 15 October the weather warning for wind in Northern Ireland on 16 October was upgraded to an amber weather warning The arrival of Ophelia brought Saharan dust to parts of the United Kingdom giving the sky an orange or yellow-sepia appearance and the sun a red or orange appearance 50 A strange burning smell was also reported across Devon also attributed to the dust and smoke from forest fires in Portugal and Spain 51 Winds up to 115 km h 71 mph were observed in Orlock Head County Down at the height of the storm Approximately 50,000 households lost power in Northern Ireland Insurance claims from Northern Ireland Wales and Scotland are estimated to reach 5 10 million US 6.6 13.2 million 52 Estonia edit In Tallinn Estonia black rain fell because Ophelia brought smoke and the soot of fires to Estonia from Portugal as well as dust from the Sahara Desert Report informs citing the Estonian media We looked at photos from satellites and the Finnish weather service confirmed that the smoke and soot of the fires in Portugal and partly the dust from the Sahara reached us meteorologist Taimi Paljak said 53 54 Records edit Hurricane Ophelia was the easternmost major hurricane at Category 3 intensity or higher ever observed in the North Atlantic basin 16 17 Hurricane Ophelia s intensification into a hurricane also made the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season the fourth such season to see 10 consecutive hurricanes after the 1878 1886 and 1893 seasons as far as records go 12 13 nb 1 Relation to climate change edit Climate scientist Reindert Haarsma of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute said that climate change is likely to cause Europe to see more hurricanes like Ophelia as the oceans get warmer although they were still comparing their model s results previously reported in 2013 with those from other climate centres 55 See also edit Tropical
