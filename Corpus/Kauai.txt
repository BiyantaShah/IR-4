prepared a huge armada of ships and canoes to take the islands by force and twice failed once due to a storm and once due to an epidemic In the face of the threat of a further invasion however Kaumuali i decided to join the kingdom without bloodshed and became Kamehameha s vassal in 1810 He ceded the island to the Kingdom of Hawai i upon his death in 1824 5 Sch ffer affair edit Main article Sch ffer affair In 1815 a ship from the Russian-American Company was wrecked on the island In 1816 an agreement was signed by Kaumuali i to allow the Russians to build Fort Elizabeth It was an attempt

name s origin in the legend of Hawai iloa the Polynesian navigator credited with discovery of the Hawai ian Islands The story relates how he named the island of Kaua i after a favorite son a possible translation of Kaua i is place around the neck describing how a father would carry a favorite child Another possible translation is food season 7 Kaua i was known for its distinct dialect of the Hawaiian language this survives on Ni ihau While the standard language today adopts the dialect of Hawai i island which has the sound k the Kaua i dialect was known for pronouncing this as t In effect Kaua i dialect retained the old pan-Polynesian t while standard Hawai i dialect has changed it to the k clarification needed Therefore the native name for Kaua i was said as Taua i and the major settlement of Kapa a would have been pronounced as Tapa a Geography edit Kalalau Beach Kaua i s origins are volcanic the island having been formed by the passage of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaii hotspot At approximately six million years old it is the oldest of the main islands The highest peak on this mountainous island is Kawaikini at 5,243 feet 1,598 m 8 The second highest peak is Mount Wai ale ale near the center of the island 5,148 ft 1,569 m above sea level One of the wettest spots on earth with an annual average rainfall of 460 inches 1,200 cm is located on the east side of Mount Wai ale ale The high annual rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountains carving out canyons with many scenic waterfalls On the west side of the island Waimea town is located at the mouth of the Waimea River whose flow formed Waimea Canyon one of the world s most scenic canyons which is part of Waimea Canyon State Park At 3,000 ft 914 m deep Waimea Canyon is often referred to as The Grand Canyon of the Pacific Kokeo Point lies on the south side of the island The Na Pali Coast is a center for recreation in a wild setting including kayaking past the beaches or hiking on the trail along the coastal cliffs 9 The headland Kuahonu Point is on the south-east of the island Climate edit Kaua i s climate is tropical with generally humid and stable conditions year round although weather phenomena and infrequent storms have caused instances of extreme weather At the lower elevations the annual precipitation varies from an average of about 50 inches on the windward northeastern shore to less than 20 inches on the southwestern leeward side of the island Average temperature in Lihu e the county seat ranges from 78 F 26 C in February to 85 F 29 C in August and September Kaua i s mountainous regions offer cooler temperatures and provide a pleasant contrast to the warm coastal areas At the K ke e state park 3,200 4,200 ft 980 1,280 m ASL day temperatures vary from an average of 45 F 7 C in January to 68 F 20 C in July In the winter temperatures have been known to drop down to the 30s and 40s at K ke e state park which holds an unofficial record low of 29 F 2 C recorded in February 1986 at Kanaloahuluhulu Meadow Precipitation in Kaua i s mountainous regions averages 50 100 in 1,300 2,500 mm annually Situated about 10 mi 16 km southeast of K ke e state park at an elevation of 5,075 ft 1,547 m is the Mt Wai ale ale rain gauge 10 Mt Wai ale ale is often cited in literature as being the wettest spot on earth although this has been disputed Based on data for the period from 1931 through 1960 the average yearly precipitation was 460 in 12,000 mm US Environmental Science Services Administration 1968 Between 1949 and 2004 the average yearly precipitation at Mt Wai ale ale was 374 in 9,500 mm 11 Not only does Kaua i hold a record in average yearly precipitation it also holds a record in hourly precipitation During a storm on January 24 25 1956 a rain gauge at Kaua i s former Kilauea Sugar Plantation recorded a record 12 in 300 mm of precipitation in just 60 minutes The 12 in 300 mm value for one hour is an underestimate since the rain gauge overflowed which may have resulted in an error by as much as an inch 12 An accurate measurement may have exceeded Holt Missouri s world record 60-minute rainfall of 12 inches in 42 minutes on June 22 1947 13
