Hurricane Maria This article is about the Atlantic hurricane of 2017 For other storms of the same name see Tropical Storm Maria Hurricane Maria is regarded as the worst natural disaster on record in Dominica and caused catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico The tenth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record Maria was the thirteenth named storm seventh consecutive hurricane fourth major hurricane and the second Category 5 hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 Atlantic hurricane season At its peak the hurricane caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the northeastern Caribbean compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the Leeward Islands already struck by Hurricane Irma just two weeks prior Maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the Leeward Islands in two weeks after Irma made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and Hurricane Jose passed dangerously close bringing tropical storm force winds to Barbuda Originating from a tropical wave Maria became a tropical storm on September 16 east of the Lesser Antilles Remarkably favorable environmental conditions allowed the storm to undergo explosive intensification as it approached the island arc The hurricane reached Category 5 strength on September 18 upon making landfall on Dominica producing extreme winds across the entire island Afterwards Maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern Caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 km h and a pressure of 908 mbar hPa 26.81 inHg making it the tenth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record Weakening slightly but retaining its ferocious winds Maria struck Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane on September 20 Interaction with land weakened the hurricane though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of The Bahamas Moving slowly to the north Maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on September 28 Embedded in the westerlies Maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open Atlantic becoming extratropical on September 30 and dissipating by October 3 As of November 3 at least 97 people are confirmed to have been killed by the hurricane 54 in Puerto Rico 28 in Dominica 5 in the Dominican Republic 4 in the contiguous United States 3 in Haiti 2 in Guadeloupe and 1 in the United States Virgin Islands Hundreds of others mostly in Dominica and Puerto Rico are still missing Maria wrought catastrophic damage to the entirety of Dominica which suffered an island-wide communication blackout Much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair while the island s lush vegetation had been practically eradicated The islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique endured widespread flooding damaged roofs and uprooted trees Puerto Rico suffered catastrophic damage including destruction of its previously damaged electrical grid For weeks in Maria s wake most of the island s population suffered from flooding and lack of resources compounded by the slow relief process Total losses from the hurricane are estimated at between 15.9 and 95 billion 2017 USD mostly in Puerto Rico making Maria s cost comparable to that of previous Hurricanes Irma and Harvey 1 2 3 4 Meteorological history edit Map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the Saffir Simpson scale The National Hurricane Center NHC began monitoring two tropical waves on September 13 5 The easternmost wave quickly spun up into what would become Hurricane Lee while the western one continued moving generally westward With generally favorable conditions in the disturbance s path development into a tropical cyclone seemed likely 6 During those two days the disturbance became better organized 7 and by September 16 convective banding became established around a poorly organized circulation As the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined the NHC initiated advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen at 15 00 UTC in accordance with a policy change enacted at the start of the season 8 9 A mid-level ridge anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest into a region highly favorable for further development Sea surface temperatures of 84 F 29 C low wind shear and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status before the system reached the Lesser Antilles 8 10 As the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined throughout the day it was later upgraded to a moderate-range tropical storm based on satellite estimates at 21 00 UTC that day receiving the name Maria 11 At that time Maria was situated 620 mi 1,000 km east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles 12 A central dense overcast and favorable outflow developed atop the center of circulation which enabled Maria to become further organized throughout the early morning hours of September 17 10 After a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the circulation 14 a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed Hurricane Hunters investigating the system observed surface winds of 74 mph 119 km h and a formative eye feature Accordingly the NHC upgraded Maria to hurricane status at 21 00 UTC 15 Expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the overnight of September 17 18 16 Considerable lightning activity was identified within the hurricane s core early on September 18 and statistical models indicated a high probability of rapid intensification 17 Explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of 120 mph 195 km h and a central pressure of 959 mbar hPa 28.32 inHg making Maria a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale and hence a major hurricane Additionally radar data revealed a well-defined 12 mi 19 km wide eye 18 The eye contracted slightly to 9 mi 14 km as intensification continued and the system reached Category 4 strength by 21 00 UTC 19 Radar imagery of Hurricane Maria from Puerto Rico at 09 36 UTC 5 36 am local time shortly before it stopped transmitting data Rapid intensification culminated late on September 18 with Maria achieving Category 5 status just 15 mi 25 km east-southeast of Dominica 20 Hurricane Hunters observed surface winds of 160 mph 260 km h and a pressure of 925 mbar hPa 27.32 inHg at this time 21 Maria made landfall in Dominica at 01 15 UTC on September 19 22 becoming the first Category 5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation 23 Interaction with the mountains of Dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to Category 4 however once over the Caribbean Sea Maria regained Category 5 intensity 24 25 Additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward Puerto Rico Despite the formation of concentric eyewalls the larger one spanning 25 to 35 mi 40 to 56 km and the smaller only 5 mi 8.0 km signalling the start of an eyewall replacement cycle the inner violent core remained undisrupted through the afternoon 26 Maria attained its peak intensity around 04 00 UTC on September 20 roughly 30 mi 45 km south of St Croix Sustained winds reached 175 mph 280 km h and its central pressure bottomed out at 908 mbar hPa 26.85 inHg this ranks it as the tenth-most intense Atlantic hurricane since reliable records began 27 28 29 Infrared loop of Hurricane Maria passing St Croix Vieques and landfalling on Puerto Rico on the morning of September 20 The hurricane made its closest approach to St Croix around 05 00 UTC on September 20 passing within 20 mi 30 km of the island the storm s outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained offshore 30 Hours later around 08 00 UTC the outer eyewall struck Vieques an island off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico 31 By this time the outer eye became dominant as the inner one decayed and the eyewall replacement cycle caused Maria to weaken to Category 4 strength 32 Maria made landfall just south of Yabucoa Puerto Rico around 10 15 UTC with sustained winds of 155 mph 250 km h 33 making it the strongest to hit the island since the 1928 San Felipe Segundo hurricane 34 Maria maintained a general west-northwest course across Puerto Rico emerging over the Atlantic Ocean shortly before 18 00 UTC Interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening sustained winds fell to 110 mph 175 km h and the central pressure rose to 957 mbars hPa 28.26 inHg 35 With favorable environmental conditions Maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from Puerto Rico A large eye 45 mi 75 km wide developed with deep convection blossoming around it Early on September 21 the system regained Category 3 intensity 36 Initially cooler waters stirred up by Hurricane Irma two weeks prior limited Maria s reorganization 37 During the afternoon of September 21 the system traversed the Navidad and Silver banks north of the Dominican Republic shoaling from the region s shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface winds 38 Convection around the storm s eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night and the hurricane reached a tertiary peak with sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h 39 An increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the eyewall 40 41 Late on September 22 the hurricane turned north-northwest as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it northwest 42 Maria fluctuated in organization throughout September 23 with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled it maintained Category 3 hurricane strength during this phase 43 44 Despite a decreasing central pressure the storm finally weakened to Category 2 strength early on September 24 Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of 116 to 135 mph 187 to 217 km h however surface wind returns by the NOAA s Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer were only 90 mph 150 km h This indicated below-average mixing down of winds aloft 45 46 By this time Maria s trajectory shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a cut-off low over the eastern Gulf of Mexico 46 Weakening accelerated later on September 24 into September 25 as the hurricane traversed a cold wake with sea surface temperatures of 75 77 F 24 25 C created by Hurricane Jose a week prior Maria degraded to Category 1 strength during this time 47 Early on September 25 Maria s structure changed dramatically as its inner-core collapsed The low-level circulation became exposed to the northwest and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the storm 48 Maria further weakened into a tropical storm during the late afternoon of September 26 49 However a sustained convective burst resulted in Maria s winds increasing to hurricane-force once again on September 27 50 with banding features evident on the eastern part of the circulation 51 Despite this northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm and Maria once again weakened to a tropical storm early on September 28 Simultaneously Maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies 52 Gradually weakening Maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of 73 F 23 C and below causing most of its convection to dissipate Late on September 30 Maria transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 53 During the next couple of days Maria s remnant accelerated towards the United Kingdom while rapidly weakening 54 55 Maria s remnants later crossed the Iberian Peninsula into the western Mediterranean Sea on October 3 before being absorbed by another frontal system later on the same day 56 Preparations edit Play media The US Navy helps evacuate military personnel from the US Virgin Islands ahead of Hurricane Maria Upon the initiation of the National Hurricane Center NHC s first advisories for the system that would become Tropical Storm Maria on the morning of September 16 the government of France issued tropical storm watches for the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe while St Lucia issued a tropical storm watch for its citizens and the government of Barbados issued a similar watch for Dominica 57 Barbados would later that day declare a tropical storm watch for its citizens and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 58 The government of Antigua and Barbuda issued Hurricane watches for the islands of Antigua Barbuda St Kitts Nevis and Montserrat by the time of the NHC s second advisory which declared Maria a tropical storm 59 60 The Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters for humanitarian satellite coverage on the 20th 61 Puerto Rico edit Still recovering from Hurricane Irma two weeks prior approximately 80,000 remained without power as Maria approached 62 Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority PREPA struggled with increasing debt reaching 9 billion even before the hurricanes prompting them to file for bankruptcy Furthermore the company lost 30 percent of its employees since 2012 Aging infrastructure across the island makes the grid more susceptible to damage from storms the median age of PREPA power plants is 44 years Inadequate safety also plagues the company and local newspapers frequently describe poor maintenance and outdated controls 63 The island s water system was also troubled before the hurricanes Seventy percent of the island had water that didn t meet the standards of the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act according to the Natural Resources Defense Council 64 Evacuation orders were issued in Puerto Rico in advance of Maria and officials announced that 450 shelters would open in the afternoon of September 18 65 As of September 19 at least 2,000 people in Puerto Rico had sought shelter 66 Mainland United States edit As Maria approached the coast of North Carolina and threatened to bring tropical storm conditions a storm surge warning was issued for the coast between Ocracoke Inlet and Cape Hatteras while a storm surge watch was issued for the Pamlico Sound the lower Neuse River and the Alligator River on the morning of September 26 A state of emergency was declared by officials in Dare and Hyde counties while visitors were ordered to evacuate Hatteras and Ocracoke islands 67 Ferry service between Ocracoke and Cedar Island was suspended the evening of September 25 and remained suspended on September 26 and 27 due to rough seas while ferry service between Ocracoke and Hatteras Island was suspended on September 26 and 27 67 68 The port in Morehead City was closed by the United States Coast Guard on the morning of September 26 67 Schools in Dare County closed on September 26 and 27 while schools in Carteret and Tyrrell counties along with Ocracoke Island dismissed early on September 26 in anticipation of high winds 67 68 Schools in Currituck County were closed on September 27 due to high winds 68 Impact in the Lesser Antilles edit Windward Islands edit The outer rainbands of Maria produced heavy rainfall and strong gusts across the southern Windward Islands 83 The Hewanorra and George F L Charles airports of Saint Lucia respectively recorded 4.33 in 110 mm and 3.1 in 80 mm of rain though even higher quantities fell elsewhere on the island 84 Scattered rock slides landslides and uprooted trees caused minor damage and blocked some roads 85 Several districts experienced localized blackouts due to downed or damaged power lines 86 The agricultural sector especially the banana industry suffered losses from the winds 85 Heavy rainfall amounting to 3 5 in 75 125 mm 87 caused scattered flooding across Barbados in Christ Church the flood waters trapped residents from the neighborhood of Goodland in their homes and inundated the business streets of Saint Lawrence Gap 88 89 Maria stirred up rough seas that flooded coastal sidewalks in Bridgetown and damaged boats as operators had difficulties securing their vessels 90 High winds triggered an island-wide power outage and downed a coconut tree onto a residence in Saint Joseph 91 92 Passing 30 mi 50 km off the northern shorelines Maria brought torrential rainfall and strong gusts to Martinique but spared the island of its hurricane-force windfield 93 which at the time extended 25 mi 35 km around the eye 94 The commune of Le Marigot recorded 6.7 inches 170 mm of rain over a 24-hour period 95 By September 19 Maria had knocked out power to 70,000 households about 40 of the population 96 Water service was cut to 50,000 customers especially in the communes of Le Morne-Rouge and Gros-Morne 93 97 Numerous roads and streets especially along the northern coast were impassible due to rock slides fallen trees and toppled power poles 97 96 Streets in Fort-de-France were inundated 93 In the seaside commune of Le Carbet rough seas washed ashore large rocks and demolished some coastal structures 93 98 while some boats were blown over along the bay of the commune of Sch lcher 99 Martinique s agricultural sector suffered considerable losses about 70 of banana crops sustained wind damage with nearly every tree downed along the northern coast 100 There were no deaths on the island although four people were injured in the hurricane two seriously and two lightly 97 Dominica edit An aerial view of part of Roseau revealing widespread damage to roofs Flash floods clogged roads with debris vegetative and structural and mud Rainfall ahead of the hurricane caused several landslides in Dominica as water levels across the island began to rise by the afternoon of September 18 101 Maria made landfall at 21 15 AST that day 1 15 UTC September 19 as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph 260 km h 22 These winds the most extreme to ever impact the island 102 battered the roof of practically every home including the official residence of Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit who required rescue when his home began to flood 103 Downing all cellular radio and internet services Maria effectively cut Dominica off from the outside world the situation there remained unclear for a couple of days after the hurricane s passage 104 105 Skerrit called the devastation mind boggling before going offline and indicated immediate priority was to rescue survivors rather than assess damage 104 Initial ham radio reports from the capital of Roseau on September 19 indicated total devastation with half the city flooded cars stranded and stretches of residential area flattened 106 The next morning the first aerial footage of Dominica elucidated the scope of the destruction 107 Maria left the mountainous country blanketed in a field of debris Rows of houses along the entirety of the coastline were rendered uninhabitable as widespread floods and landslides littered neighborhoods with the structural remnants 107 108 The hurricane also inflicted extensive damage to roads and public buildings such as schools stores and churches 108 and affected all of Dominica s 73,000 residents in some form or way 109 The air control towers and terminal buildings of the Canefield and Douglas Charles airports were severely damaged although the runways remained relatively intact and open to emergency landings 109 The disaster affected all of the island s 53 health facilities including the badly damaged primary hospital compromising the safety of many patients 107 110 A road in the Roseau area is littered with structural debris damaged vegetation and downed power poles and lines The infrastructure of Roseau was left in ruins practically every power pole and line was downed and the main road was reduced to fragments of flooded asphalt The winds stripped the public library of its roof panels and demolished all but one wall of the Baptist church 111 To the south of Roseau riverside flooding and numerous landslides impacted the town of Pointe Michel destroying about 80 of its structures and causing most of the deaths in the country 112 113 Outside the capital area the worst of the destruction was concentrated around the east coast and rural areas where collapsed roads and bridges isolated many villages 109 The port and fishing town of Marigot Saint Andrew Parish was 80 damaged 114 Settlements in Saint David Parish such as Castle Bruce Good Hope and Grand Fond had been practically eradicated many homes hung off cliffs or decoupled from their foundations In Rosalie rushing waters gushed over the village s bridge and damaged facilities in its bay area Throughout Saint Patrick Parish the extreme winds ripped through roofs and scorched the vegetation Buildings in Grand Bay the parish s main settlement experienced total roof failure or were otherwise structurally compromised Many houses in La Plaine caved in or slid into rivers and its single bridge was broken 115 Overall the hurricane damaged the roofs of as much as 98 of the island s buildings 109 including those serving as shelters 107 half of the houses had their frames destroyed 109 Its ferocious winds defoliated nearly all vegetation splintering or uprooting thousands of trees and decimating the island s lush rainforests 116 The agricultural sector a vital source of income for the country was completely wiped out 100 of banana and tuber plantations was lost as well as vast amounts of livestock and farm equipment 109 In Maria s wake Dominica s population suffered from an island-wide water shortage due to uprooted pipes The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency CDEMA estimates that the hurricane has caused billions of dollars worth of damage 117 As of October 9 there are 28 fatalities confirmed across the island with another 32 people reported missing 70 Guadeloupe edit Numerous trees fell across Guadeloupe clogging roadways with debris Blustery conditions spread over Guadeloupe as Maria tracked to the south of the archipelago which endured hours of unabating hurricane-force winds 118 The strongest winds blew along the southern coastlines of Basse-Terre Island Gourbeyre observed a peak wind speed of 101 mph 162 km h while winds up north in nearby Baillif reached 92 mph 148 km h 119 Along those regions the hurricane kicked up extremely rough seas with 20 ft 6 m waves 120 The combination of rough seas and winds was responsible for widespread structural damage and flooding throughout the archipelago especially from Pointe- -Pitre along Grand-Terre Island s southwestern coast to Petit-Bourg and the southern coasts on Basse-Terre Island 73 Aside from wind-related effects rainfall from Maria was also significant In just a day the hurricane dropped nearly a month s worth of rainfall at some important locations Pointe- -Pitre recorded a 24-hour total of 7.5 inches 191 mm while the capital of Basse-Terre measured 6.4 in 163 mm 95 Even greater quantities fell at higher elevations of Basse Terre Island with a maximum total of 18.07 in 459 mm measured at the mountainous locality of Matouba Saint-Claude 119 Throughout the archipelago the hurricane left 40 of the population 80,000 households without power and 25 of landline users without service 121 The islands of Marie-Galante La D sirade and especially Les Saintes bore the brunt of the winds which caused heavy damage to structures and nature alike and cut the islands off from their surroundings for several days 73 121 Homes on Terre-de-Haut Island of Les Saintes were flooded or lost their roofs 122 On the mainland sections of Pointe- -Pitre stood under more than 3.3 feet 1 m of water and the city s hospital sustained significant damage 97 The Basse-Terre region suffered severe damage to nearly 100 of its banana crops comrpising a total area of more than 5,000 acres 2,000 hectares farmers described the destruction to their plantations as complete annihilation 100 Beyond their impact on farmland the strong winds ravaged much of the island s vegetation fallen trees and branches covered practically every major road and were responsible for one death 121 Another person was killed upon being swept out to sea 73 Two people disappeared at sea after their vessel capsized offshore La D sirade east of mainland Grande-Terre 121 Damage from Maria across Guadeloupe amounted to at least 100 million US 120 million 123 United States Virgin Islands edit Maria s outer eyewall was reported by the National Hurricane Center to have crossed Saint Croix while the hurricane was at Category 5 intensity The hurricane caused extensive and severe damage to the island Sustained winds at the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge reached 99 to 104 mph 159 to 167 km h and gusted to 137 mph 220 km h 124 The Luis Hospital suffered roof damage and flooding but remained operational 125 One person died from a storm-induced heart attack 80 Impact in the Greater Antilles and the United States edit Puerto Rico edit The storm made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday September 20 132 A sustained wind of 64 mph 103 km h with a gust to 113 mph 182 km h was reported in San Juan Puerto Rico immediately prior to the hurricane making landfall on the island After landfall wind gusts of 109 mph 175 km h were reported at Yabucoa Harbor and 118 mph 190 km h at Camp Santiago 133 In addition very heavy rainfall occurred throughout the territory peaking at 37.9 in 962.7 mm in Caguas 134 Widespread flooding affected San Juan waist-deep in some areas and numerous structures lost their roof 132 The coastal La Perla neighborhood of San Juan was largely destroyed 135 Cata o saw extensive damage with the Juana Matos neighborhood estimated to be 80 percent destroyed 136 The primary airport in San Juan the Luis Mu oz Mar n International Airport was slated to reopen on September 22 137 Storm surge and flash flooding stemming from flood gate releases at La Plata Lake Dam converged on the town of Toa Baja trapping thousands of residents Survivors indicate that flood waters rose at least 6 ft 1.8 m in 30 minutes with flood waters reaching a depth of 15 ft 4.6 m in some areas More than 2,000 people were rescued once military relief reached the town 24 hours after the storm At least eight people died due to the flooding while many are unaccounted for 138 Thousands of homes suffered varying degrees of damage while large swaths of vegetation were shredded by the hurricane s violent winds As of October 14 the death toll stood at 48 with about 117 people missing 139 On September 24 Governor Rossell estimated that the damage from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico was surely over the 8 billion damage by Hurricane Georges 140 Approximately 80 percent of the territory s agriculture was lost due to the hurricane with agricultural losses estimated at 780 million 141 The hurricane completely destroyed the island s power grid leaving all 3.4 million residents without electricity 136 142 143 Puerto Rican governor Ricardo Rossell stated that it could take months to restore power in some locations 144 with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz estimating that some areas would remain without power for four to six months 145 Communication networks were crippled across the island Ninety-five percent of cell networks were down with 48 of the island s 78 counties networks being completely inoperable 142 Eighty-five per cent of above-ground phone and internet cables were knocked out 146 Only one radio station WAPA 680 AM remained on-air through the storm 142 NEXRAD radar destroyed by Maria The NEXRAD Doppler weather radar of Puerto Rico has also been literally blown away The radome which covers the radar antenna and which had to withstand winds of more than 130 mph was destroyed while the antenna of 30 feet in diameter was blown from the pedestal the latter remaining intact The radar is 2800 feet above sea level and the anemometer at the site measured winds of about 145 mph before communications broke which means winds at that height were likely 20 percent higher than what was seen at sea level Its replacement will take a few months 147 The nearby island of Vieques suffered similarly extensive damage Communications were largely lost across the island Widespread property destruction took place with many structures leveled 148 Play media Hurricane Maria at Coast Guard Sector San Juan The recreational ship Ferrel carrying a family of four issued a distress signal while battling 20 ft 6.1 m seas and 115 mph 185 km h winds on September 20 149 Communications with the vessel were lost near Vieques on September 20 The United States Coast Guard United States Navy and British Royal Navy conducted search-and-rescue operations utilizing an HC-130 aircraft a fast response cutter USS Kearsarge RFA Mounts Bay and Navy helicopters 150 On September 21 the mother and her two children were rescued while the father drowned inside the capsized vessel 149 Maria s Category 4 winds broke a 96-foot 29 m line feed antenna of the Arecibo Observatory causing it to fall 500 feet 150 m and puncturing the dish below greatly reducing its ability to function until repairs can be made 151 152 Hispaniola edit Torrential rains and strong winds impacted the Dominican Republic as Maria tracked northeast of the country Assessments on September 22 indicate 110 homes were destroyed 570 were damaged and 3,723 were affected by flooding Approximately 60,000 people lost power in northern areas of the country Flooding and landslides rendered many roads impassable cutting off 38 communities 153 Five people all of them males were killed in the Dominican Republic four of them were of Haitian origin killed when they were swept away by floodwaters the fifth person was a Dominican man who died in a landslide 71 Hurricane Maria center passed 250 km from Haiti northern coast but has received a large amount of rain and suffered some flooding Three deaths were reported a 45-year-old man died in the commune of Limbe in the department of the North while attempting to cross a flooded river Two other people a woman and a man were mortally wounded in Cornillon a small town 40 kilometers east of the capital Port-au-Prince according to the authorities 74 Mainland United States edit Maria brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on September 26 as the center of the storm passed by offshore and brought tropical storm conditions to the area along with a storm surge large waves and rip currents to the coast The storm knocked out power to 800 Duke Energy Progress customers in the Havelock area with restoration of power expected to take several hours 67 Dominion North Carolina Power and Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative experienced scattered power outages Winds of 23 mph 37 km h and gusts of 41 mph 66 km h were reported at Dare County Regional Airport at Manteo on September 27 while winds of 40 mph 64 km h were reported in Duck 68 Maria caused beach erosion at the ferry terminal at the north end of Ocracoke Island that washed out a portion of the paved lanes where vehicles wait to board the ferry By the morning of September 26 the storm flooded North Carolina Highway 12 along the coast 67 Rip currents from Maria caused three swimmers to drown and several others to be rescued at the Jersey Shore on the weekend of September 23 24 154 A fourth drowning death occurred in Fernandina Beach Florida 82 Aftermath edit Dominica edit A SH-60 Seahawk flies over Dominica en route to deliver humanitarian aid The mountainous terrain of the island poses serious challenges to relief operations in more remote areas In the wake of the hurricane more than 85 of the island s houses were damaged of which more than 25 were completely destroyed leaving more than 50,000 of the island s 73,000 residents displaced 155 Following the destruction of thousands of homes most supermarkets and the water supply system many of Dominica s residents were in dire need of food water and shelter for days 108 With no access to electricity or running water and with sewage systems destroyed fears of widespread diarrhea and dysentery arose The island s agriculture a vital source of income for many was obliterated as most trees were flattened Meanwhile the driving force of the economy tourism was expected to be scarce in the months that followed Maria Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit characterized the devastation wrought by Irma and Maria as a sign of climate change and the threat it poses to the survival of his country stating To deny climate change is to deny a truth we have just lived 155 Many islanders suffered respiratory problems as a result of excessive dust borne out of debris Light rainfall in the weeks following Maria alleviated this problem though it also slowed recovery efforts particularly rebuilding damaged rooftops 156 Through the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility Dominica received approximately US 19.2 million in emergency funds 157 USS Wasp previously deployed to Saint Martin to assist in relief efforts after Hurricane Irma arrived in Dominica on September 22 The vessel carried two Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters to assist in distribution of relief supplies in hard-to-reach areas 158 At the United Nations General Assembly on September 23 Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit called the situation in Dominica an international humanitarian emergency 159 The Royal Canadian Navy vessel HMCS St John s was dispatched to Dominica 160 at the request of Dominican Prime Minister Skerrit 161 The prime minister urged churches to encourage their membership to provide housing for senior citizens and disabled many of whom remained in damaged structures despite tarpaulin donations from Venezuela Palestine Cuba Jamaica and other countries As schools began to reopen on October 16 the United Nations Children s Fund reported that the entire child population of Dominica 23,000 children remained vulnerable due to restricted access to clean drinking water 156 Puerto Rico edit Play media US Officials Say Damaged Infrastructure Slows Aid Distribution in Puerto Rico video from Voice of America The power grid was effectively destroyed by the hurricane leaving millions without electricity 163 Governor Ricardo Rossell estimated that Maria caused at least US 90 billion in damage 164 165 As of September 26 95 of the island was without power less than half the population had tap water and 95 of the island had no cell phone service 166 On October 6 a little more than two weeks after the hurricane 89 still had no power 44 had no water service and 58 had no cell service 167 One month after the hurricane 88 of the island was without power about 3 million people 29 lacked tap water about 1 million people and 40 of the island had no cell service All hospitals were open but most were on backup generators that provide limited power About half of sewage treatment plants on the island were not still not functioning FEMA reported 60,000 homes needed roofing help and had distributed 38,000 roofing tarps 168 The island s highways and bridges remained heavily damaged nearly a month later Only 392 miles of Puerto Rico s 5,073 miles of road were open Some towns continue to be isolated and delivery of relief supplies including food and water are hampered-- helicopters are the only alternative 169 As of October 1 there were ongoing fuel shortage and distribution problems with 720 of 1,100 gas stations open 170 The Guajataca Dam was structurally damaged and on September 22 the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency for parts of the area in response 171 Tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate the area with about 70,000 thought to be at risk 172 The entirety of Puerto Rico was declared a Federal Disaster Zone shortly after the hurricane 162 The Federal Emergency Management Agency planned to open an air bridge with three to four aircraft carrying essential supplies to the island daily starting on September 22 142 Beyond flights involving the relief effort limited commercial traffic resumed at Luis Mu oz Mar n International Airport on September 22 under primitive conditions A dozen commercial flights operated daily as of September 26 173 By October 3 there were 39 commercial flights per day from all Puerto Rican airports about a quarter of the normal number 174 The next day airports were reported to be operating at normal capacity 175 In marked contrast to the

contaminated animal urine With large areas of Puerto Rico lacking clean water residents were forced to used contaminated sources of water As of October 23 at least 4 people may have died from the

to portray relief efforts as more successful than they are 214 Between September 20 and October 18 the island s only medical examiner authorized 911 bodies for cremation The cause of death for the persons are listed as natural causes however 215 Whitefish Energy edit Comparison of lights at night in Puerto Rico before top and after bottom Hurricane Maria Note Lower image date should read September 25 2017 Soon after the hurricane struck Whitefish Energy a small Montana-based company with only two full-time employees was awarded a 300 million contract by PREPA to repair Puerto Rico s power grid The company contracted more than 300 personnel and sent them to the island to carry out work PREPA cited Whitefish s comparatively small upfront cost of 3.7 million for mobilization as one of the main reasons for contracting them over larger companies PREPA Executive Director Ricardo Ramos stated Whitefish was the only company -- it was the first that could be mobilized to Puerto Rico It did not ask us to be paid soon or a guarantee to pay 216 No requests for assistance were made to the American Public Power Association by October 24 216 The decision to hire such a tiny company was considered highly unusual by many such as former Energy Department official Susan Tierney who stated The fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out it is at least odd why the utility would go to Whitefish As the company was based in Whitefish Mont the hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke this also led to accusations of privatization though Zinke dismissed these claims and stated that he had no role in securing the contract 217 Several representatives both Democrats and Republicans also voiced their concern over the choice to contract Whitefish instead of other companies 216 In a press release on October 27 FEMA stated it did not approve of PREPA s contract with Whitefish and cited significant concerns 218 Governor Rossell subsequently ordered an audit of the contract s budget DHS Inspector General John Roth led the FEMA audit while Governor Rossell called for a second review by Puerto Rico s Office of

222 and UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from the Tennessee Army National Guard Nearly a month after the hurricane only 16 percent of people in St Thomas and 1.6 percent of people in St Croix have had electricity restored 223 Criticism of US government response edit San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz pictured harshly criticized the federal response to Maria in Puerto Rico as inadequate The US Department of Homeland Security DHS did not immediately waive the Jones Act for Puerto Rico which prevented the commonwealth from receiving any aid and supplies from non-US-flagged vessels from US ports 224 The waiver was granted after two days while in contrast the waiver was not granted for Hurricane Harvey until fourteen days after the hurricane and was narrowly drafted to only allow fuel transportation for seven days 225 A DHS Security spokesman said that there would be enough US shipping for Puerto Rico and that the limiting factors would be port capacity and local transport capacity 226 226 227 228 This statement was supported by AFL CIO which issued a fact checking statement regarding the Jones Act and its effect upon recovery relief 229 The Jones Act was waived for a period of ten days starting on September 28 following a formal request by Puerto Rico Governor Rossell 230 San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz called the disaster a terrifying humanitarian crisis and pleaded for relief efforts to be sped up on September 26 231 The White House contested claims that the administration was not responding effectively 232 General Joseph L Lengyel Chief of the National Guard Bureau defended the Trump Administration s response and reiterated that relief efforts were hampered by Puerto Rico being an island rather than on the mainland 233 President Donald Trump responded to accusations that he does not care about Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is very important to me and Puerto Rico -- the people are fantastic people I grew up in New York so I know many people from Puerto Rico I know many Puerto Ricans And these are great people and we have to help them The island is devastated 234 Frustrated with the federal government s slow and inadequate response relief group Oxfam announced on October 2 that it plans to get involved in the humanitarian aid effort sending a team to assess a targeted and effective response and support its local partners on-the-ground efforts 235 On October 2 2017 Oxfam released a rare statement While the US government is engaged in relief efforts it has failed to address the most urgent needs Oxfam has monitored the response in Puerto Rico closely and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the US Government has mounted said Oxfam America s president Abby Maxman Oxfam rarely responds to humanitarian emergencies in the US and other wealthy countries but as the situation in Puerto Rico worsens and the federal government s response continues to falter we have decided to step in The US has more than enough resources to mobilize an emergency response but has failed to do so in a swift and robust manner 236 In an update on October 19 the agency called the situation in Puerto Rico unacceptable and called for a more robust and efficient response from the US government 237 A rally for victims of the hurricane and Puerto Rico s status in general took place in Long Beach California on October 3 On October 3 2017 President Trump visited Puerto Rico He compared the damage from Hurricane Maria to that of Hurricane Katrina saying If you looked every death is a horror but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overbearing nobody has seen anything like this What is your death count as of this morning 17 238 Trump s remarks were widely criticized for implying that Hurricane Maria was not a real catastrophe 239 240 While in Puerto Rico Trump also distributed canned goods and paper towels to crowds gathered at a relief shelter 241 and told the residents of the devastated island I hate to tell you Puerto Rico but you ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that s fine We saved a lot of lives 242 On October 12 Trump tweeted We cannot keep FEMA the Military the First Responders who have been amazing under the most difficult circumstances in PR forever 243 prompting further criticism from lawmakers in both parties 244 Mayor Cruz replied You are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done 204 In response to a request for clarification on the tweet from Governor Rossell John F Kelly assured that no resources were being pulled and replied Our country will stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done 245 See also edit Tropical cyclones portal List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Tropical cyclones and climate
