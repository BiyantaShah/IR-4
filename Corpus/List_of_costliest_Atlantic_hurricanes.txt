List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes Damage in Long Beach Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina This is a list of costliest Atlantic hurricanes Hurricanes as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA are tropical cyclones a warm-core non-frontal synoptic-scale cyclone originating over tropical or subtropical waters with organized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulation about a well-defined center in the Atlantic Caribbean Sea Gulf of Mexico or eastern Pacific in which the maximum 1-minute sustained surface wind exceeds 64 knots 74 mph 119 km h or greater The hurricanes on the list below depict the severity of the damage the system has caused Typically if a hurricane has caused significant damage to a particular location its name is retired so that it will not be re-used as a name for any future hurricanes The costliest tropical cyclone ever recorded was Hurricane Harvey which caused catastrophic flooding in southeastern Texas in August 2017 causing 198.6 billion 2017 USD in property damage The costliest season on record was 2017 with damage estimated in excess of 300 billion A majority of the costliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history have peaked as major hurricanes However weaker tropical cyclones can still cause widespread damage Both tropical storms Allison in 2001 and Lee in 2011 have caused over a billion in damage the former of which accounted for a higher damage total Due to their excessive damage the names of tropical cyclones accruing at least 1 billion in damage are often retired by the World Meteorological Organization However this is not always the case Hurricane Juan in 1985 was the first hurricane to cause at least a billion in damage and not be retired its name was retired on a later usage in 2003 that did not cause over a billion in damage Since Juan seven tropical cyclones that caused at least a billion in damage were not retired including Hurricane Emily in 2005 and the most recent of which being Hurricane Isaac in 2012 All other 47 Atlantic hurricanes to have caused as much damage have had their names retired excluding recent hurricanes Harvey Irma Maria and Ophelia of the 2017 season The first hurricane to cause at least 1 billion in damage was Hurricane Betsy in 1965 which caused much of its damage in southeastern Louisiana Between two and four years later Hurricanes Beulah and Camille both caused at least 1 billion in damage After the 1960s each decade saw an increase in tropical cyclones causing at least a billion in damage over the last due to increasing urban development and population In the 1970s four hurricanes caused at least a billion in damage the costliest of which was Hurricane Frederic which caused 2.3 billion in damage particularly in Mississippi and Alabama The following decade featured seven hurricanes causing at least a billion in damage In the 1989 season Hurricane Hugo was the first storm to hit 10 billion US dollars in cost In the 1990s nine tropical cyclones accrued at least a billion in damage Hurricane Andrew in 1992 greatly exceeded the damage figure of any preceding tropical cyclone after causing 26.5 billion in damage mostly in South Florida Seventeen tropical cyclones in the 2000s caused at least 1 billion in damage The 2005 season had six billion-dollar hurricanes the most of any season on record Hurricane Ivan caused at least 1 billion in damage in four separate countries and according to estimates Hurricane Irma caused at least 1 billion in damage in five separate countries Thus far in the 2010s eleven storms have caused at least 1 billion in damage with the costliest so far being Hurricane Harvey which caused 198.6 billion in damage Overall costliest edit High water marker in Portsmouth North Carolina listing water levels for flooding caused by hurricanes Isabel Gloria Alex Dennis Ophelia Gustav Emily and several unnamed storms This list ranks tropical cyclones within the Atlantic that have accrued at least US 1 billion in damage based on their nominal USD damage totals Because these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation nor adjusted for changes in population and wealth in coastal counties the costliness of recent hurricanes is artificially inflated compared to hurricanes of the past This makes it hard to accurately compare the damage inflicted by hurricanes across time Hurricanes Irma Maria and Ophelia are not included in this list yet as final damage costs are not determined yet Preliminary estimates for Irma place the cost of the storm between 50 and 112 billion 1 2 3 4 5 6 Preliminary estimates for Maria put the cost of the storm at 15.9 billion to 95 billion 7 Preliminary estimates for Ophelia put the cost of the storm at 2.1
