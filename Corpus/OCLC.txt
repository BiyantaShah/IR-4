OCLC OCLC currently incorporated as OCLC Online Computer Library Center Incorporated 3 is an American nonprofit cooperative organization dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world s information and reducing information costs 4 It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat the largest online public access catalog OPAC in the world OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services around 200 million annually as of 2016 update 1 OCLC also maintains the Dewey Decimal Classification system History edit OCLC began in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center through a collaboration of Ohio university presidents vice presidents and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative computerized network for Ohio libraries The group first met on July 5 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization 5 The group hired Frederick G Kilgour a former Yale University medical school librarian to design the shared cataloging system 6 Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time the computer with the oldest the library The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations control costs and increase efficiency in library management The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world s information to best serve researchers and scholars The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26 1971 This was the first occurrence of online cataloging by any library worldwide 5 Membership in OCLC is based on use of services and contribution of data Between 1967 and 1977 OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio but in 1978 a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join In 2002 the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States 7 As OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with networks organizations that provided training support and marketing services By 2008 there were 15 independent United States regional service providers OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance with networks electing delegates to serve on OCLC Members Council During 2008 OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels at the same time the OCLC Members Council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees which severed the tie between the networks and governance In early 2009 OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center 8 Services edit OCLC provides bibliographic abstract and full-text information to anyone OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat the OCLC Online Union Catalog the largest online public access catalog OPAC in the world WorldCat has holding records from public and private libraries worldwide The Open WorldCat program launched in late 2003 exposed a subset of WorldCat records to Web users via popular Internet search bibliographic and bookselling sites 9 Open WorldCat later morphed into WorldCatorg In October 2005 the OCLC technical staff began a wiki project WikiD allowing readers to add commentary and structured-field information associated with any WorldCat record 10 WikiD was later phased out The Online Computer Library Center acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the Dewey Decimal Classification System when it bought Forest Press in 1988 A browser 11 for books with their Dewey Decimal Classifications was available until July 2013 it was replaced by the Classify Service Until August 2009 when it was sold to Backstage Library Works OCLC owned a preservation microfilm and digitization operation called the OCLC Preservation Service Center 12 with its principal office in Bethlehem Pennsylvania US The reference management service QuestionPoint 13 provides libraries with tools to communicate with users This around-the-clock reference service is provided by a cooperative of participating global libraries OCLC has produced catalog cards for members since 1971 with its shared online catalog the company printed its last catalog cards on October 1 2015 14 Software edit OCLC commercially sells software eg CONTENTdm for managing digital collections 15 Research edit OCLC has been conducting research for the library community for more than 30

founding in 1967 OCLC staff members meet and work regularly with library leaders information professionals researchers entrepreneurs political leaders trustees students and patrons to advocate advancing research scholarship education community development information access and global cooperation 21 22 WebJunction 23 is a division of OCLC funded by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which provides training services to librarians OCLC s advocacy campaign Geek the Library started in 2009 highlights the role of public libraries The campaign funded by a grant from the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation uses a strategy based on the findings of the 2008 OCLC report From Awareness to Funding A study of library support in America 24 Other past advocacy campaigns have focused on sharing the knowledge gained from library and information research Such projects have included communities such as the Society of American Archivists the Open Archives Initiative the Institute for Museum and Library Services the International Organization for Standardization the National Information Standards Organization the World Wide Web Consortium the Internet Engineering Task Force and Internet2 One of the most successful contributions to this effort was the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative an open forum of libraries archives museums technology organizations and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models 21 OCLC partnered with search engine providers in 2003 to advocate for libraries and share information across the broadest possible Internet landscape Google Yahoo and Askcom have all collaborated with OCLC to make the WorldCat records searchable through those search engines 21 Online database WorldCat edit Main article WorldCat OCLC s WorldCat database is used by librarians for cataloging and research Contributions to WorldCat are made via the Connexion computer program which was introduced in 2001 its predecessor OCLC Passport was phased out in May 2005 WorldCat contains records in MAchine Readable Cataloging MARC format contributed by library catalogers worldwide who use OCLC as a cataloging tool and these MARC format records can also be downloaded into other libraries local catalog systems This allows libraries to find and download records for materials they are adding to their local catalog without having to undergo the lengthy process of creating a new catalog entry from scratch for each new item As of March 2015 the OCLC database contained over 336 million records with 2.2 billion cataloged items and is the world s largest bibliographic database covering 72,000 libraries 25 Connexion is available to professional librarians as a computer program or on the web at connexionoclcorg WorldCat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web-based service called FirstSearch 26 as well as through the publicly available WorldCatorg 27 Identifiers and linked data edit OCLC assigns a unique control number referred to as an OCN for OCLC Control Number to each new bibliographic record in the WorldCat Numbers are assigned serially and as of mid-2013 over a billion OCNs had been created In September 2013 the OCLC declared these numbers to be in the public domain removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself 28 The control numbers link WorldCat s records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries 29 OCNs are particularly useful as identifiers for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have ISBNs eg books published before 1970 OCNs are used as identifiers often in Wikipedia and Wikidata In October 2013 it was reported that out of 29,673 instances of Infobox Book in Wikipedia there were 23,304 ISBNs and 15,226 OCNs and regarding Wikidata of around 14 million Wikidata items 28,741 were books 5403 Wikidata items have an ISBN associated with them and 12,262 have OCNs 30 OCLC also runs the Virtual International Authority File VIAF an international name authority file VIAF numbers are broadly used as standard idenfitiers Company acquisitions edit OCLC offices in Leiden the Netherlands OCLC acquired NetLibrary a provider of electronic books and textbooks in 2002 and sold it in 2010
