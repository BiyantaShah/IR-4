Geometric terms of location Geometric terms of location describe directions or positions relative to the shape of an object These terms are used in descriptions of engineering physics and other sciences as well as ordinary day to day discourse Though these terms by themselves may be somewhat ambiguous they are usually used in a context in which their meaning is clear For example when referring to a drive shaft it is clear what is meant by axial or radial directions Or in a free body diagram one may similarly infer a sense of orientation by the forces or other vectors represented Examples edit Common geometric terms of location are Adjacent - next to Axial along the center of a round body or the axis of rotation of a body Azimuthal or circumferential following around a curve or circumference of an object For instance the pattern of cells in Taylor Couette flow varies along the azimuth of the experiment Collinear - in the same line Degree of freedom - axis direction see six degrees of freedom Lateral spanning the width of a body Lineal following along a given path The shape of the path is not necessarily straight compare to linear For instance a length of rope might be measured in lineal meters or feet See arc length Longitudinal spanning the length of a body The distinction between width and length may be unclear out of context Orthogonal at right angles to a line or more generally on a different axis Parallel - in the same direction Perpendicular - at right angles to synonym to orthogonal Radial along a direction pointing along a radius from the center of an object or perpendicular to a curved path Tangential intersecting a curve at a point and parallel to the curve at that point Transverse orthogonal to a specified direction such as a particle trajectory or an axis of rotation edit
