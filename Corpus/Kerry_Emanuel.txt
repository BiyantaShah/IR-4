Kerry Emanuel Kerry Andrew Emanuel born April 21 1955 is an American professor of meteorology currently working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge In particular he has specialized in atmospheric convection and the mechanisms acting to intensify hurricanes He was named one of the Time 100 influential people of 2006 1 In 2007 he was elected as a member of the US National Academy of Sciences 2 He hypothesized in 1994 about a superpowerful type of hurricane which could be formed if average sea surface temperature increased another 15C more than it s ever been see hypercane In a March 2008 paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society he put forward the conclusion that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity 3 Gabriel Vecchi of NOAA said of Emanuel s announcement While his results don t rule out the possibility that global warming has contributed to the recent increase in activity in the Atlantic they suggest that other factors possibly in addition to global warming are likely to have been substantial contributors to the observed increase in activity 4 In 2013 with other leading experts he was co-author of an open letter to policy makers which stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity s ability to avoid dangerous climate change 5 Along with Daniel H Rothman Emanuel co-founded the MIT Lorenz Center named for Edward N Lorenz 6 7 See also edit Wind-induced surface heat exchange edit Selected publications edit Emanuel KA 1994 Atmospheric Convection Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-506630-8 Emanuel KA 2005 Divine Wind The History And Science Of Hurricanes ISBN 0-19-514941-6 Emanuel KA 2005 Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years Nature Emanuel KA 2007 Phaeton s Reins - The human hand in climate change Boston Review Emanuel KA 2007 What We Know About Climate Change The MIT Press Boston Review ISBN 978-0-262-05089-0 Emanuel KA 2008 Hurricanes and Global Warming Results from Downscaling IPCC AR4 Simulations Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society edit Emanuel s website Kerry Emanuel publications indexed by Google Scholar Brian Tang and Kerry Emanuel 2010 Mid-level ventilation s constraint on tropical cyclone intensity Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences Volume 67 Issue 6 Brian Tang and Kerry Emanuel 2012 A ventilation index for tropical cyclones Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society Volume 93 Issue 12
