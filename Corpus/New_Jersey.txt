Skylands in Ringwood State Park Passaic and Bergen counties New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States It is a peninsula bordered on the north and east by the state of New York on the east southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and Delaware New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 US states New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest state by median household income as of 2016 20 New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast In the early 17th century the Dutch and the Swedes made the first European settlements in the state 21 The English later seized control of the region 22 naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands Jersey 23 and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton New Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century In the 19th century factories in cities known as the Big Six 24 Camden Paterson Newark Trenton Jersey City and Elizabeth helped to drive the Industrial Revolution New Jersey s geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis between Boston and New York City to the northeast and Philadelphia Baltimore and Washington DC to the southwest fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century In the first decades of the 21st century this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey s culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state 25 26 with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 27 History Main article History of New Jersey Around 180 million years ago during the Jurassic Period New Jersey bordered North Africa The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains Around 18,000 years ago the Ice Age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey As the glaciers retreated they left behind Lake Passaic as well as many rivers swamps and gorges 28 New Jersey was originally settled by Native Americans with the Lenni-Lenape being dominant at the time of contact Scheyichbi is the Lenape name for the land that is now New Jersey 29 The Lenape were several autonomous groups that practiced maize agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in the region surrounding the Delaware River the lower Hudson River and western Long Island Sound The Lenape society was divided into matrilinear clans that were based upon common female ancestors These clans were organized into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign Turtle Turkey and Wolf They first encountered the Dutch in the early 17th century and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through fur trade Colonial era Main article Colonial history of New Jersey The relative location of the New Netherland and New Sweden settlements in eastern North America The Dutch became the first Europeans to lay claim to lands in New Jersey The Dutch colony of New Netherland consisted of parts of modern Middle Atlantic states Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape Dutch West India Company policy required its colonists to purchase the land that they settled The first to do so was Michiel Pauw who established a patronship called Pavonia in 1630 along the North River which eventually became the Bergen Peter Minuit s purchase of lands along the Delaware River established the colony of New Sweden The entire region became a territory of England on June 24 1664 after an English fleet under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls sailed into what is today New York Harbor and took control of Fort Amsterdam annexing the entire province During the English Civil War the Channel Island of Jersey remained loyal to the British Crown and gave sanctuary to the King It was from the Royal Square in St Helier that Charles II of England was proclaimed King in 1649 following the execution of his father Charles I The North American lands were divided by Charles II who gave his brother the Duke of York later King James II the region between New England and Maryland as a proprietary colony as opposed to a royal colony James then granted the land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River the land that would become New Jersey to two friends who had remained loyal through the English Civil War Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton 30 The area was named the Province of New Jersey Since the state s inception New Jersey has been characterized by ethnic and religious diversity New England Congregationalists settled alongside Scots Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed migrants While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of 100 acres 40 ha a few rich proprietors owned vast estates English Quakers and Anglicans owned large landholdings Unlike Plymouth Colony Jamestown and other colonies New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era and commercial farming developed sporadically Some townships such as Burlington on the Delaware River and Perth Amboy emerged as important ports for shipping to New York City and Philadelphia The colony s fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers and New Jersey s population had increased to 120,000 by 1775 Settlement for the first 10 years of English rule took place along Hackensack River and Arthur Kill settlers came primarily from New York and New England On March 18 1673 Berkeley sold his half of the colony to Quakers in England who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker colony William Penn acted as trustee for the lands for a time New Jersey was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces East and West Jersey for 28 years between 1674 and 1702 at times part of the Province of New York or Dominion of New England In 1702 the two provinces were reunited under a royal governor rather than a proprietary one Edward Hyde Lord Cornbury became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony Britain believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler taking bribes and speculating on land In 1708 he was recalled to England New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey who accused those governors of favoritism to New York Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738 31 Revolutionary War era Main article New Jersey in the American Revolution New Jersey was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution The New Jersey Constitution of 1776 was passed July 2 1776 just two days before the Second Continental Congress declared American Independence from Great Britain It was an act of the Provincial Congress which made itself into the state Legislature To reassure neutrals it provided that it would become void if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain New Jersey representatives Richard Stockton John Witherspoon Francis Hopkinson John Hart and Abraham Clark were among those who signed the United States Declaration of Independence Washington Crossing the Delaware during the New York and New Jersey campaign winter 1777 During the American Revolutionary War British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times and several pivotal battles took place in the state Because of this New Jersey today is often referred to as The Crossroads of the American Revolution 32 The winter quarters of the Continental Army were established there twice by General George Washington in Morristown which has been called The Military Capital of the American Revolution 33 George Washington rallying his troops at the Battle of Princeton On the night of December 25 26 1776 the Continental Army under George Washington crossed the Delaware River After the crossing he surprised and defeated the Hessian troops in the Battle of Trenton Slightly more than a week after victory at Trenton American forces gained an important victory by stopping General Cornwallis s charges at the Second Battle of Trenton By evading Cornwallis s army Washington made a surprise attack on Princeton and successfully defeated the British forces there on January 3 1777 Emanuel Leutze s painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware became an icon of the Revolution American forces under Washington met the forces under General Henry Clinton at the Battle of Monmouth in an indecisive engagement in June 1778 Washington attempted to take the British column by surprise when the British army attempted to flank the Americans the Americans retreated in disorder The ranks were later reorganized and withstood the British charges In the summer of 1783 the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall at Princeton University making Princeton the nation s capital for four months It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the Treaty of Paris 1783 which ended the war On December 18 1787 New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey as it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging tariffs on goods imported from Europe On November 20 1789 the state became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the Bill of Rights The 1776 New Jersey State Constitution gave the vote to all inhabitants who had a certain level of wealth This included women and blacks but not married women because they could not own property separately from their husbands Both sides in several elections claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of petticoat electors whether entitled to vote or not on the other hand both parties passed Voting Rights Acts In 1807 the legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male suffrage excluding paupers the constitution was itself an act of the legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution 34 19th century Main article New Jersey in the 19th century On February 15 1804 New Jersey became the last northern state to abolish new slavery and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery This led to a gradual decrease of the slave population By the close of the Civil War about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still held in bondage 35 New Jersey voters initially refused to ratify the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States black population A map of the 107-mile long Morris Canal across northern New Jersey Industrialization accelerated in the northern part of the state following completion of the Morris Canal in 1831 The canal allowed for coal to be brought from eastern Pennsylvania s Lehigh Valley to northern New Jersey s growing industries in Paterson Newark and Jersey City In 1844 the second state constitution was ratified and brought into effect Counties thereby became districts for the State Senate and some realignment of boundaries including the creation of Mercer County immediately followed This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution but was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1962 by the decision Baker v Carr While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him or to the people and it gave him a three-year term but he could not succeed himself New Jersey was one of the few Union states the others being Delaware and Kentucky to select a candidate other than Abraham Lincoln twice in national elections and sided with Stephen Douglas 1860 and George B McClellan 1864 during their campaigns McClellan a native Philadelphian had New Jersey ties and formally resided in New Jersey at the time he later became Governor of New Jersey 1878 81 In New Jersey the factions of the Democratic party managed an effective coalition in 1860 During the American Civil War the state was led first by Republican Governor Charles Smith Olden then by Democrat Joel Parker During the course of the war over 80,000 from the state enlisted in the Northern army unlike many states including some Northern ones no battle was fought there citation needed View of state s largest city Newark in 1874 In the Industrial Revolution cities like Paterson grew and prospered Previously the economy had been largely agrarian which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil This caused a shift to a more industrialized economy one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk Inventor Thomas Edison also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution having been granted 1,093 patents many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey Edison s facilities first at Menlo Park and then in West Orange are considered perhaps the first research centers in the US Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting Transportation was greatly improved as locomotion and steamboats were introduced to New Jersey Iron mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century Bog iron pits in the southern New Jersey Pinelands were among the first sources of iron for the new nation 36 Mines such as Mt Hope Mine Hill and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the Morris Canal Zinc mines were also a major industry especially the Sterling Hill Mine Thomas Edison in his laboratory West Orange New Jersey 1901 20th century Main article New Jersey in the 20th

Jersey State Senate thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process In 2002 and 2007 President of the State Senate Richard Codey held the position of acting governor for a short time and from 2004 to 2006 Codey became a long-term acting governor due to Jim McGreevey s resignation A 2005 amendment to the state Constitution prevents the Senate President from becoming

completely divided into counties by 1692 the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones most recently Union County in 1857 New Jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called Freeholders governing each county as part of its own Board of Chosen Freeholders The number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum and must consist of three five seven or nine members Depending on the county the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government In 16 counties members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis with each Freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments In the other 5 counties Atlantic Bergen Essex Hudson and Mercer there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders

the Local Unit Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission began a study of about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidation 163 Forms of municipal government Starting in the 20th century largely driven by reform-minded goals a series of six modern forms of government was implemented This began with the Walsh Act enacted in 1911 by the New Jersey Legislature which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis This was followed by the 1923 Municipal Manager Law which offered a non-partisan council provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council and introduced a Council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs The Faulkner Act originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981 offers four basic plans Mayor-Council Council-Manager Small Municipality and Mayor-Council-Administrator The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government the number of seats on the Council seats selected at-large by wards or through a combination of both staggered or concurrent terms of office and a mayor chosen by the Council or elected directly by voters Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey s residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a Special Charter with the approval of the New Jersey Legislature citation needed While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public For example though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type Loch Arbour is the only one remaining with the village form of government The other three villages Ridgefield Park now with a Walsh Act form Ridgewood now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter and South Orange now operates under a Special Charter have all migrated to other non-village forms citation needed Politics Main article Politics of New Jersey Social attitudes and issues Socially New Jersey is considered one of the more
