Convair CV-240 family The Convair CV-240 is an American airliner produced by Convair from 1947 to 1954 initially as a possible replacement of the ubiquitous Douglas DC-3 Featuring a more modern design with cabin pressurization the 240 series was able to make some inroads as a commercial airliner and also had a long development cycle which resulted in various civil and military variants Although reduced in numbers through attrition the Convairliners in various forms continue to fly into the 21st century 1 Design and development edit The design began its life in a requirement by American Airlines for an airliner to replace its Douglas DC-3s Convair s original design the unpressurised Model 110 was a twin-engine low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction with 30 seats It was powered by Pratt Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines and had a tricycle landing gear and a ventral airstair for passenger boarding 2 The prototype Model 110 registration NX90653 first flew on July 8 1946 2 By this time American had changed its requirements to require pressurization and deemed the design too small The first prototype was used by Convair for development work for the 240 series before being broken up in 1947 3 A 1949-built Convair 240 of Swiss Air Lines at Manchester England in March 1950 To meet the requirements of airlines for a pressurized airliner Convair produced a revised design the Model 240 This had a longer but thinner fuselage than the Model 110 accommodating 40 passengers in the first pressurized twin-engined airliner 4 The 240 first flew on March 16 1947 5 The Model 240 was followed by the Model 340 that had a longer fuselage longer-span wings and more powerful engines The 340 first flew on October 5 1951 6 In 1954 in an attempt to compete with turboprop-powered airliners like the Vickers Viscount Convair produced the Model 440 Metropolitan with more streamlined cowlings new engine exhausts and better soundproofing for the cabin 7 As the Super 240 evolved into the CV-340 and CV-440 the limit of piston-engine performance was reached and future development centered on conversion to turboprop power 1 Operational history edit The first delivery of a production Convairliner was to American on February 29 1948 5 A total of 75 were delivered to American with another 50 going to Western Airlines Continental Airlines Pan American Airways KLM Swissair Sabena and Trans Australia Airlines 8 Two Convair 580s of the Aspen Colorado-based Aspen Airways at Stapleton International Airport in Denver US in 1986 A CV-240 was the first private aircraft used in a United States presidential campaign In 1960 John F Kennedy used a CV-240 named Caroline after his daughter during his campaign This aircraft is now preserved in the National Air and Space Museum After aborted negotiations with TWA and Eastern for Super 240 orders the production of the 240 series was temporarily halted In response to a United inquiry Convair redesigned the Super 240 calling it the CV-340 United ordered 55 and more US orders came from Braniff Continental Delta Northeast and National Other orders came from abroad and the CV-340 proved popular in South America The CV-340 earned an enviable reputation for reliability and profitability and was developed into the CV-440 Metropolitan the final piston-engined variant of the Convairliners 1 Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter the major remaining operator of this model currently holds the type certificate for this aircraft Used price for a Convair 240 in 1960 was around 40,000 9 Variants edit Data from General Dynamics Aircraft and their predecessors 1 Civil variants edit Convair 340 of KLM landing at Manchester Ringway Airport in 1954 Convair 440 Metropolitan of Lufthansa at Copenhagen Kastrup Airport in 1968 Convair 580 operated by the Australian arm of New Zealand airline Pionair This example was converted from a CV-340 Convair 640F freighter of Kitty Hawk Aircargo converted with Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines Convair Model 110 Unpressurized prototype with seats for 30 passengers 89 ft 27.13 m wingspan 71 ft 21.64 m length powered by two 2,100 hp 1,567 kW Pratt Whitney R-2800-SC13G engines One built 2 Convair CV-240 Initial production version Powered by two Pratt Whitney R-2800 engines Convair CV-240-21 Turboliner Turboprop-powered conversion fitted with Allison T38 engines It became the first turboprop airliner to fly in the United States on December 29 1950 but problems with the engines resulted in development being terminated and the prototype being converted back to piston power Convair CV-300 A conversion from a Convair CV-240 with two R-2800 CB-17 engines and nacelles as used on the CV-340 10 In 1977 a CV-300 was involved in an accident that killed three members and the manager of the rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd 11 Convair CV-340 Built for United Airlines and other operators including KLM the CV-340 was a CV-240 lengthened to hold an additional four seats The wingspan was extended for better performance at higher altitudes The CV-340 replaced the DC-3 in United service The airline flew 52 340s for 16 years without a fatality KLM operated the type from early 1953 until mid-1963 Many CV-340 aircraft were converted to CV-440 standard 12 Convair CV-440 Metropolitan CV-340 with improved soundproofing and an option for weather radar Maximum weight rose to 49,700 lbs An optional increase from 44 to 52 passengers was facilitated by the replacement of the carry-on luggage area with two more rows of seats marked by the addition of an extra cabin window This option was taken up by several airlines including Swissair Lufthansa and SAS 12 Finnair operated the type from 1953 until 1980 without a single accident Convair CV-540 Conversion from a Convair CV-340 aircraft with two Napier Eland turboprop engines in place of the piston engines Six aircraft were converted by Napier for Allegheny Airlines 13 Cost for the conversions was 160,000 per-aircraft
