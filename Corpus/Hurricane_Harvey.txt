Hurricane Harvey For other storms of the same name see Tropical Storm Harvey Hurricane Harvey was an extremely destructive Atlantic hurricane which was listed as the costliest tropical cyclone in the history of United States shattering the record set by Hurricane Katrina by nearly double and is the second-costliest natural disaster worldwide behind only the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami It also became the first major hurricane nb 1 to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity in the country In a four-day period many areas received more than 40 inches 100 cm of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters causing catastrophic flooding With peak accumulations of 64.58 in 164.0 cm Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States and the third-wettest on record in the Atlantic basin behind Hurricane Flora of 1963 and a November hurricane in 1909 The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes displaced more than 30,000 people and prompted more than 17,000 rescues A Category 4 hurricane at its peak intensity it was the strongest and most intense hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico since Rita in 2005 The eighth named storm third hurricane and the first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles reaching tropical storm status on August 17 The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent Upon entering the Caribbean Sea Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 19 The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucat n Peninsula before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day While the storm moved generally northwest Harvey s intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24 25 however Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day Hours later Harvey made landfall near Rockport Texas at peak intensity Afterwards rapid weakening ensued and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state On August 28 it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29 As Harvey drifted inland it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1 before dissipating two days later Harvey caused at least 91 confirmed deaths 1 in Guyana 1 and 90 in the United States 2 3 4 5 6 7 Total damage from the hurricane is estimated at 198.63 billion making it the costliest natural disaster ever in the United States 8 Meteorological history edit Map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the Saffir Simpson scale Formation and initial degeneration Caribbean edit Early on August 13 the National Hurricane Center NHC began monitoring a tropical wave on the western coast of Africa Amid favorable environmental conditions the wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure to its east southwest of Cape Verde and gradually organize thereafter 9 Instead the two disturbances remained separate with the broad trough continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north eventually becoming Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten 10 On August 17 shower and thunderstorm activity in association with the trough began to show signs of organization 11 while high-resolution satellite showed an increasingly defined low-level circulation 12 As such the NHC initiated advisories on a potential tropical cyclone allowing tropical storm watches and warnings to be hoisted for portions of the Lesser Antilles 13 An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft deployed to the disturbance later that afternoon found a well-defined center and tropical storm-force winds prompting the NHC to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Harvey at 21 00 UTC 14 Following its designation the cyclone moved swiftly westward into the Caribbean Sea under the influence of an expansive ridge of high pressure to its north An environment of moderate wind shear complicated the weather of the storm s intensity with global forecast models suggesting dissipation in the central Caribbean whereas statistical and hurricane models suggested the potential for Harvey to be near hurricane strength in later days 14 Over the next day the storm changed little in structure remaining poorly organized with its low-level center on the eastern edge of associated deep convection 15 Harvey s presentation began to deteriorate early on August 19 its convective pattern became elongated while the circulation became less defined In fact a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to find a loosely-closed circulation at 850 mb 4,781 ft though it did locate one at lower levels 16 Harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression at 21 00 UTC on August 19 17 six hours later based on continued data from a reconnaissance aircraft it was declared an open tropical wave 18 The remnants of Harvey as a tropical wave over the Gulf of Honduras on August 21 within the shadow of a total solar eclipse Early on August 20 the NHC began monitoring the remnants of Harvey for redevelopment Although the effects of strong upper-level winds and dry air were expected to limit development in the near-term conditions were expected to become more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane conditions when the disturbance entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea and especially in the Bay of Campeche 19 Despite an increase in convective organization the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center as it approached the Yucat n Peninsula 20 While traversing inland satellite images and surface observations indicated that the circulation became better defined 21 Regeneration peak intensity and stalling Gulf of Mexico edit A reconnaissance aircraft investigating the remnants of Harvey around 15 00 UTC on August 23 indicated that it once again acquired a well-defined center and the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression accordingly 22 The system began to slowly consolidate amid an increasingly favorable environment 23 attaining tropical storm intensity by 06 00 UTC on August 24 24 Later that morning Harvey began to undergo rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell 25 By 17 00 UTC the storm was upgraded to the third hurricane of the season 26 Slight entrainment of dry air slowed the intensification process however by the next day Harvey was able to quickly strengthen into a Category 3 major hurricane by 19 00 UTC 27 Further deepening occurred as the storm approached the coast of Texas with Harvey becoming a Category 4 hurricane at 23 00 UTC based on reconnaissance aircraft data 28 Around 03 00 UTC on August 26 the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity at Rockport with winds of 130 mph 215 km h and an atmospheric pressure of 938 mbar 27.7 inHg 29 Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since Charley in 2004 It was the first hurricane to strike Texas since Hurricane Ike in 2008 30 the first major hurricane in the state since Bret in 1999 and the strongest in Texas since Carla in 1961 31 Harvey as a hurricane on August 24 After striking land the storm moved over the Copano Bay and made a second landfall in Texas just north of Holiday Beach at 06 00 UTC on August 26 as a Category 3 hurricane 32 Afterwards rapid weakening ensued as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm at 18 00 UTC on August 26 33 For about two days the storm stalled just inland dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding Harvey s center drifted back towards the southeast positioning itself near or just off the Texas coast at Matagorda by 15 00 UTC on August 28 34 Once offshore convection blossomed and allowed the once-exposed low-level circulation to become obscured An Air Force reconnaissance plane investigating the system during the afternoon of August 29 found that maximum winds had increased to 50 mph 85 km h 35 Around 09 00 UTC the next morning Harvey made its third and final landfall just west of Cameron Louisiana with winds of 45 mph 75 km h 36 Final landfall and dissipation Eastern United States edit The system continued north and then north-northeast weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana around 00 00 UTC on August 30 37 Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September 1 indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 15 00 UTC that day 38 However Harvey s remnants continued moving northeastward while slowly weakening Late on September 2 the WPC issued its final advisory on Harvey s remnant low while it was located over Ohio 39 Harvey s remnants continued to drift northward before being absorbed by another low pressure system north of Lake Erie late on September 3 40

chemicals to decompose and become combustible Two explosions occurred around 2 00 am on August 31 21 emergency personnel were briefly hospitalized 101 Due to the shutdown in refineries gas prices did see an increase nationwide 102 However the increase was not as extensive as Hurricane Katrina due to the development of more fuel-efficient vehicles as well as fracking technology having been refined since Katrina to allow oil drilling in shale areas such as the Marcellus Formation 103 Additionally Harvey s impact coincided with Labor Day Weekend which sees a traditional increase in gas prices due to the heavy travel for that weekend 104 Nonetheless the spike brought the highest gas prices in two years 103 Sports edit In the aftermath of the storm the Houston Astros began wearing this patch

Trump signs HR 601 into effect providing 15 billion in disaster relief for hurricane victims Based on current damage estimates made by multiple agencies Hurricane Harvey is likely to be at least the second-most costly natural disaster in US history behind only Hurricane Katrina in 2005 139 140 Moody s Analytics has estimated the total economic cost of the storm at 81 billion to 108 billion or more most of the economic losses are damage to homes and commercial property 139 USA Today reported an AccuWeather estimate of 190 billion released August 31 141 On September 3 Texas state governor Greg Abbott estimated that damages will be between 150 billion and 180 billion surpassing the 120 billion that it took to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina 142 143 According to weather analytics firm Planalytics lost revenue to Houston area retailers and restaurants alone will be approximately 1 billion The Houston area controls 4 of the spending power in the United States 144 In September 2017 the Insurance Council of Texas estimated the total insured losses from Hurricane Harvey at 19 billion This figure represents 11 billion in flood losses insured by the National Flood Insurance Program NFIP 3 billion in insured windstorm and other storm-related property losses and about 4.75 billion in insured flood losses of private and commercial vehicles 145 A significant portion of the storm s damages may be uninsured losses Regular homeowner insurance policies generally exclude coverage for flooding as the NFIP underwrites most flood insurance policies in the US 146 147 Although the purchase of flood insurance is obligatory for federally guaranteed mortgages for homes within the 100-year flood plain enforcement of the requirement is difficult and many homes even within the 100-year flood plain lack flood insurance 146 In Harris County Texas which includes the city of Houston only 15 of homes have flood insurance policies issued by the NFIP Participation in the NFIP is higher but still low in neighboring Galveston 41 Brazoria 26 and Chambers Counties 21 146 Homeowners sued authorities after reservoir releases damaged homes 148 Federal government response edit On

relief will be expecting 25,000 to 30,000 meals a day 158 On August 27 2017 KSL-TV KSL Newsradio FM100.3 and 103.5 The Arrow created a fundraiser to help Texas residents impacted by Hurricane Harvey Because of an anonymous donor willing to match 2 for every 1 raised up to a total of 100,000 Peter Huntsman also agreed to match donations up to 100,000 The combined total of 200,000 was met by August 31 2017 Their new goal is 1 million 159 Foreign government response edit Singapore dispatched Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Republic of Singapore Air Force to areas affected by the hurricane for humanitarian operations working alongside the Texas National Guard 160 Israel pledged 1 million in relief funds for restoration of non-state run communal infrastructure 161 Mexico sent volunteers from the Mexican Red Cross firemen from Coahuila and rescue teams from Guanajuato to Houston to assist in relief 162 Mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after Hurricane Katia made landfall on Mexico s Gulf Coast on September 9 2017 163 Venezuela offered 5 million through the state-owned Citgo Petroleum which operates a refinery in Corpus Christi 164 Health and environmental hazards in flood waters edit The floodwaters contain a number of hazards to the environment and human health The Houston Health Department stated that millions of contaminants were present in floodwaters 165 These include E coli and coliform bacteria measurements of colony-forming units showed the concentrations were so high that there were risks of contracting flesh-eating disease from the water 166 Houston officials stated that the Houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact however hundreds of thousands of people across the 38 Texas counties affected by Hurricane Harvey use private wells according to an estimate by Louisiana State University researchers and those people must fend for themselves 165 Additionally Harris County which includes Houston contains a large number of Superfund-designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens 165 Two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi were flooded 165 Environmental factors edit The Geography of Houston places it in a low-lying part of the Gulf Coastal Plain and its clay-based soils provide poor drainage The climate of Houston brings very heavy rainfall which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836 though the flood control district founded in 1947 aided by the US Army Corps of Engineers managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years More recently residents died in historic flooding in May 2015 and in the April 2016 tax day floods 167 168 There is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period as occurred during Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979 and Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 169 The area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea The main waterways the San Jacinto River and the Buffalo Bayou meander slowly laden with mud and have little capacity for carrying storm water 170 Urban development edit Houston has seen rapid urban development urban sprawl with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels 171 Between 1992 and 2010 almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons 172 However Harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area 173 The Katy Prairie in western Harris County which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in Harris County since 2010 174 Subsidence edit Extraction of oil and groundwater from underground aquifers leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse a process called subsidence Houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence in some cases as much as 9 feet 2.7 m These result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently so storm water drains more slowly 175 The coastline near Houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches 15 cm in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the effects of climate change 176 175 Climate change edit See also Tropical cyclone Climate change The Gulf of Mexico is known for hurricanes in August so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms Studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall 177 Weather events are due to multiple factors and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition but climate change affects aspects of extreme events and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey 178 In a briefing the World Meteorological Organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from Harvey had very likely been increased by climate change The relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes or tropical cyclones is still unclear and is the subject of continuing research 179 Harvey approached Houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures Warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger more intense and longer lasting in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall 180 177 Sea level rise added to the resulting problems 178 According to officials from the Harris County Flood Control District Harvey caused the third 500-year flood in three years 181 182 183 The National Climate Assessment states The recent increases in activity are linked in part to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that Atlantic hurricanes form in and move through Numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures including natural variability human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases and particulate pollution Quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research 184 Warmer air can hold more water vapour in accordance with the Clausius Clapeyron relation and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records 178 Regional sea surface temperatures around Houston have risen around 0.5 C 0.9 F in recent decades which caused a 3 5 increase in moisture in the atmosphere This had the effect of allowing Harvey to strengthen more than expected 176 The water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico was above average for this time of the year and likely to be a factor in Harvey s impact 185 Within a week of Harvey Hurricane Irma formed due to the same unusually warm sea-water Some scientists fear this may be becoming a new normal Also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating 186 The slow movement of Harvey over Texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state as has also happened with earlier storms 169 Harvey s stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the time which had pushed the jet stream to the north Research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change 176 187 See also
