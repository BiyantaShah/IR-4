Absolute angular momentum In meteorology absolute angular momentum refers to the angular momentum in an absolute coordinate system absolute time and space Introduction edit Angular momentum L equates with the cross product of the position vector r of a particle or fluid parcel and its absolute linear momentum p equal to mv the product of mass and velocity Mathematically Definition edit Absolute angular momentum sums the angular momentum of a particle or fluid parcel in a relative coordinate system and the angular momentum of that relative coordinate system Meteorologists typically express the three vector components of velocity v u v w eastward northward and upward The magnitude of the absolute angular momentum L per unit mass m where M represents absolute angular momentum per unit mass of the fluid parcel in m2 s r represents distance from the center of the earth to the fluid parcel in m u represents earth-relative eastward component of velocity of the fluid parcel in m s represents latitude in rad and represents angular rate of Earth s rotation in rad s usually 2 rad 1 sidereal day 72.921150 10 6rad s The first term represents the angular momentum of the parcel with respect to the surface of the earth which depends strongly on weather The second term represents the angular momentum of the earth itself at a particular latitude essentially constant at least on non-geological timescales Applications edit In the shallow troposphere of the earth one can approximate r a the distance between the fluid parcel and the center of the earth approximately equal to the mean Earth radius where a represents Earth radius in m usually 6.371009 Mm M represents absolute angular momentum per unit mass of the fluid parcel in m2 s u represents earth-relative eastward component of velocity of the fluid parcel in m s represents latitude in rad and represents angular rate of Earth s rotation in rad s usually 2 rad 1 sidereal day 72.921150 10 6rad s At the North Pole and South Pole latitude 90 2rad no absolute angular momentum can exist M 0 m2 s because cos 90 0 If a fluid parcel with no eastward wind speed u0 0m s originating at the equator 0 rad so cos cos 0 rad 1 conserves its angular momentum M0 M as it moves poleward then its eastward wind speed increases dramatically u0 a cos 0 a2 cos2 0 u a cos a2 cos2 After those substitutions a2 u a cos a2 cos2 or after further simplification a 1-cos2 u cos Solution for u gives a 1 cos - cos u If 15 cos 1 3 2 2 then 72.921150 10 6rad s 6.371009 Mm 2 2 1 3 - 1 3 2 2 32.2m s u The zonal pressure gradient and eddy stresses cause torque that changes the absolute angular momentum of fluid parcels edit Holton James R Hakim Gregory J 2012 An introduction to dynamic meteorology 5 Waltham Massachusetts Academic Press pp 342 343 ISBN 978-0-12-384866-6
