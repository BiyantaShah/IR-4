Joule This article is about the unit of energy For other uses see Joule disambiguation The joule d u l symbol J is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units 1 It is equal to the energy transferred to or work done on an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre 1 newton metre or N m It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule 1818 1889 2 3 4 In terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units where kg is the kilogram m is the metre s is the second N is the newton Pa is the pascal W is the watt C is the coulomb and V is the volt One joule can also be defined as The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt or one coulomb-volt C V This relationship can be used to define the volt The work required to produce one watt of power for one second or one watt-second W s compare kilowatt-hour 3.6 megajoules This relationship can be used to define the watt Usage edit This SI unit is named after James Prescott Joule As with every International System of Units SI unit named for a person the first letter of its symbol is upper case J However when an SI unit is spelled out in English it should always begin with a lower case letter joule except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case Note that degree Celsius conforms to this rule because the d is lowercase Based on The International System of Units section 5.2 Confusion with newton metre edit Main article newton metre In mechanics the concept of force in some direction has a close analog in the concept of torque about some angle A result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the newton metre which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the Joule But they are not interchangeable The CGPM has given the unit of energy the name Joule but has not given the unit of torque any special name hence it is simply the newton metre N m a compound name derived from its constituent parts 5 The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications 5 The distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement By contrast torque is a vector the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation where E is energy is the vector magnitude of torque and is the angle swept in radians Since radians are dimensionless it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions Practical examples edit One joule in everyday life represents approximately The energy required to lift a medium-size tomato 100 g 1 m vertically from the surface of the Earth 6 The energy released when that same tomato falls back down to the ground The energy required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 m s 2 through a distance of 1 m The heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 0.24 C 7 The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1 60 s approximately 17 ms 8 The kinetic energy of a 50 kg human moving very slowly 0.2 m s or 0.72 km h The kinetic energy of a 56 g tennis ball moving at 6 m s 22 km h 9 The kinetic energy of an object with mass 1 kg moving at 2 1.4 m s The amount of electricity required to light a 1 W LED for 1 s Since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kW h kilowatt-hour a kW h is thus 1000 W 3600 s 3.6 MJ megajoules Multiples edit For additional examples see Orders of magnitude energy Zeptojoule edit The zeptojoule zJ is equal to one sextillionth 10 21 of one joule 160 zeptojoules
