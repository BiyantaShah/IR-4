Tropical cyclone warnings and watches Tropical cyclone warnings and watches are two levels of alert issued by national weather forecasting bodies to coastal areas threatened by the imminent approach of a tropical cyclone of tropical storm or hurricane intensity They are notices to the local population and civil authorities to make appropriate preparation for the cyclone including evacuation of vulnerable areas where necessary It is important that interests throughout the area of an alert make preparations to protect life and property and do not disregard it on the strength of the detailed forecast track Tropical cyclones are not points and forecasting their track remains an uncertain science Western hemisphere edit See also History of Atlantic hurricane warnings New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers 1 2 3 4 5 In conjunction with the National Hurricane Center the national meteorological and hydrological services of Central America the northern Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Pacific Ocean east of the 140th meridian west excluding mainland Africa and Europe all issue tropical storm hurricane watches and warnings 6 Tropical storm watches are issued when gale and storm force winds of between 34 63 knots 39 73 mph 63 118 km h are possible within 48 hours in a specified area in association with a tropical subtropical or post-tropical cyclone 7 These watches are upgraded to tropical storm warnings when gale and storm force winds become expected to occur somewhere in the warning area within 36 hours 7 Hurricane watches are issued when sustained winds of 64 knots 74 mph 119 km h are possible within 48 hours in a specified area in association with a tropical subtropical or post-tropical cyclone 7 These warnings are upgraded to hurricane warnings when hurricane-force winds become expected to occur somewhere in the warning area within 36 hours 7 Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force the hurricane watch and warnings are issued in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds rather than in advance of the anticipated onset of hurricane-force winds 7 At times a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch can both be in effect due to uncertainties in the forecast These watches and warnings are also issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center for the Hawaiian Islands and the Weather Forecast Office in Guam for parts of Micronesia but not for American Samoa due to an international agreement 8 Within the United States an extreme wind warning is issued by the National Weather Service for any land areas that are expected to be impacted by a major Category 3 or higher hurricane and by sustained surface winds greater than or equal to 100 knots 115 mph 185 km h 8 The warning is issued just prior to when the strongest winds of the eyewall are expected to impact an area 9 The warning is to be issued for the smallest area possible and be valid for times of two hours or less 9 It was developed in response to confusion resulting from the landfall of Hurricane Katrina NWS offices in Jackson and New Orleans Baton Rouge issued 11 tornado warnings for areas that would not experience an actual tornado but would experience extreme wind speeds commonly associated with tornadoes 10 The extreme wind warning is now expected to be used in these situations In 2017 the National Hurricane Center introduced a new system of warnings and watches for storm surge which would cover the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States A storm surge watch would be issued when a life-threatening storm surge associated with a potential or ongoing tropical subtropical or post-tropical cyclone is possible within the next 48 hours These watches would be upgraded to storm surge warnings when there is a danger of life-threatening storm surge occurring within 36 hours However both watches and warnings may be issued earlier than specified if environmental conditions are expected to hamper preparations 11 In Mexico a color coded alert system is used to keep the public informed when a tropical cyclone or possible tropical cyclones poses a threat to the nation The scale starts with blue at the bottom being minimal danger then proceeds to a green alert which means low level danger A yellow alert signifies moderate danger followed by an orange alert that means high danger level The scale tops off with a red alert the maximum level of danger 12 West Pacific systems edit China edit A two-stage warning system was long-established in China for tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity of above 13 Nowadays the use of this system is restricted to coastal waters only Thus warnings may be discontinued even if a cyclone is maintaining tropical storm intensity inland Color-coded alerts below may be in effect independently of any two-stage warnings Warning Winds may reach Beaufort Force 8 or rainstorm may occur in 48 hours Urgent Warning Winds may reach Beaufort Force 8 or rainstorm may occur in 24 hours Guangdong introduced a color-coded tropical cyclone warning system for land use in 1999 14 White alert A tropical cyclone may affect the area in 48 hours Green alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 6 in 24 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 6 7 are already blowing Yellow alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 8 in 12 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 8 9 gale force are already blowing Red alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 10 in 12 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 10 11 storm force are already blowing Black alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 12 in 12 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 12 hurricane force are already blowing Similar systems were developed in Fujian and Shanghai Later China Meteorological Administration standardized the system for national use 15 This set is part of a larger warning system that covers other forms of severe weather conditions such as extreme temperature torrential rainfall drought etc Guangdong maintained a white alert as in the old system Blue alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 6 in 24 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 6 7 are already blowing Yellow alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 8 in 24 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 8 9 gale force are already blowing Orange alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 10 in 12 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 10 11 storm force are already blowing Red alert Winds may reach Beaufort Force 12 in 6 hours or winds of Beaufort Force 12 hurricane force are already blowing Hong Kong and Macau edit Main article Hong Kong tropical cyclone warning signals The Pearl River Delta uses a variety of warning systems to inform the public regarding the risks of tropical cyclones to the area The Hong Kong Observatory issues typhoon signals to indicate the existence and effects of a tropical cyclone on Hong Kong The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau in Macau uses a similar system 16 The signal system consists of 8 signals in 5 levels numbered non-consecutively for historical reasons 17 18 Each signal has a day signal and a night signal for hoisting which are still hoisted in Macau but no longer hoisted in Hong Kong Day signals are also used as signal symbols in both places Signal No 1 A tropical cyclone is centred within 800 km of the territory and may affect the territory later Signal No 3 Strong wind with a sustained speed of 41 62 km h gusts may exceed 110 km h Signals Nos 8 NW 8 SW 8 NE 8 SE Gale or storm force wind with a sustained speed of 63 117 km h from the northwest southwest northeast southeast quadrants respectively gusts may exceed 180 km h Signal No 9 Hong Kong Gale or storm force wind is increasing or expected to increase significantly in strength Macau The centre of a tropical cyclone is approaching and Macau is expected to be severely affected Signal No 10 Hurricane force wind with a sustained speed over 118 km h gusts may exceed 220 km h Japan edit Main article Japan Meteorological Agency The Japan Meteorological Agency JMA is the government agency responsible for gathering and providing results for the public in Japan that are obtained from data based on daily scientific observation and research into natural phenomena in the fields of meteorology hydrology seismology and volcanology among other related scientific fields Its headquarters is located in Tokyo is also designated one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers RSMC of the World Meteorological Organization It has the responsibility for weather forecasting tropical cyclone naming and distribution of warnings for tropical cyclones in the Northwestern Pacific region Philippines edit The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA releases tropical cyclone warnings in the form of Public Storm Warning Signals or just storm signals 19 An area having a storm signal may be under PSWS 1 - Tropical cyclone winds of 30 61 km h are expected within the next 36 hours Note If a tropical cyclone forms very close to the area then a shorter lead time is seen on the warning bulletin PSWS 2 - Tropical cyclone winds of 61 120 km h are expected within the next 24 hours PSWS 3 - Tropical cyclone winds of 121 170 km h are expected within the next 18 hours PSWS 4 - Tropical cyclone winds of 171 220 km h are expected within 12 hours PSWS 5 - Tropical cyclone winds greater than 220 km h are expected within 12 hours These storm signals are usually heightened when an area in the Philippines only is about to be hit by a tropical cyclone Thus as a tropical cyclone gains strength and or gets closer to an area having a storm signal it may be heightened to another higher signal in that particular area Whereas as a tropical cyclone weakens and or gets farther away from an area it may be downgraded to a lower signal or may be lifted that is an area will have no storm signal South Pacific basin edit The Australian Bureau of Meteorology will issue a cyclone watch for a specified part of Australia when a tropical cyclone is expected to cause gale-force winds in excess of 62 km h 40 mph within 24 48 hours and subsequently make landfall 20 A cyclone warning is subsequently issued for a specified part of Australia when a tropical cyclone is expected to cause or is causing gale-force winds in excess of 62 km h 40 mph within 24 hours and is subsequently expected to make landfall 20 The Fiji Meteorological Service FMS issues a tropical cyclone alert for the Cook Islands Fiji Kiribati Nauru Niue Tokelau Tonga and Tuvalu when a tropical cyclone has a significant probability of causing gale-force winds or stronger winds within 24 48 hours 21 Gale storm and hurricane-force wind warnings are subsequently issued for the above areas by FMS when a tropical cyclone is either causing or expected to cause either gale storm or hurricane-force winds within 24 hours 21 M t o-France is responsible for the issuance of tropical cyclone watches and warnings for New Caledonia Wallis and Futuna French Polynesia and the Pitcairn Islands 21 The National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of the Solomon Islands Samoa Indonesia Papua New Guinea New Zealand Timor Leste and American Samoa are responsible for their own watches and warnings 21 Indian Ocean systems edit The India Meteorological Department IMD RSMC New Delhi is responsible for tracking tropical cyclones within the North Indian Ocean M t o-France in R union MFR RSMC La Reunion is responsible for the issuing advisories and tracking of tropical cyclones in the southwest part of the basin however the naming of systems is deferred to the Mauritius and Madagascar weather services India edit The IMD issues warnings in four stages for the Indian coast Stage 1 Cyclone watch - Issued 72 hours in advance it discusses the likelihood of development of a cyclonic disturbance in the north Indian Ocean and the coastal region likely to experience adverse weather Stage 2 Cyclone alert - Issued 48 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas Stage 3 Cyclone warning - Issued 24 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas The location of landfall is discussed at this stage Stage 4 Landfall outlook - Issued 12 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas The track of the cyclone after the landfall and the possible impact inland is discussed at this stage Cyclonic storm conditions mean what winds in excess of 63 km h 39 mph are possible 22 Military advisories edit Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness edit The United States Department of Defense uses a multi-stage system called the Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness TC-CORs otherwise known as the Hurricane Condition of Readiness HURCONs to prepare bases and evacuate assets and personnel in advance of adverse weather associated with tropical cyclones 23 TC-CORs are recommended by weather facilities either on base or by central sites like the National Hurricane Center or the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and are generally related to the timing and potential for destructive sustained windspeeds of above 50 kn 58 mph 93 km h 23 Recommendations are then considered by base or area commanders along with other subjective factors for setting the TC-CORs like assets holidays or the bases experience in emergency preparedness 23 The bases prefer to set these TC-CORs sequentially from TC-COR 5 with destructive winds expected within 96 hours through TC-COR 4 3 2 and if needed to a series of four different TC-COR 1 conditions however depending on the cyclone s movement or location some of these signals can be skipped 23 24 After a system passes and stops affecting the base the authorities can decide to revert to the seasonal TC-COR or stay in a heightened approach as another tropical cyclone is approaching 23 See also edit Tropical cyclones portal
