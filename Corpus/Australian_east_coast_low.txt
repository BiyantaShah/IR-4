Australian east coast low An East Coast Low on 25 June 2013 Australian east coast lows known locally as east coast lows and sometimes as east coast cyclones 1 are extratropical cyclones 2 The most intense of these systems have many of the characteristics of subtropical cyclones 3 They develop between 25 south and 40 south and within 5 of the Australian coastline 1 typically during the winter months 4 5 Each year there are about ten significant impact maritime lows 6 Prior to the introduction of satellite imagery in the early 1960s many east coast lows were classified as tropical cyclones These storms which mostly affect the south east coast should not be confused with Australian region tropical cyclones which typically affect the northern half of the continent 7 Characterisation edit Explosive cyclogenesis is seen on average just once per year but these storms cause significant wind and flood damage when they occur 4 Australian east coast cyclones vary in size from mesoscale approximately 10 100 km 6 62 mi to synoptic scale approximately 100 1,000 km 62 621 mi 8 9 Australian east coast cyclones although variable in size and intensity are typically characterised by widespread heavy rainfall 9 These storms usually occur along the subtropical east coast of Australia from Gladstone in Queensland to the Victoria New South Wales border and often affect large populated cities such as Sydney and Brisbane between which over one-third of the Australian population resides 9 Rain associated damages attributed to east coast cyclones are estimated in millions to tens of million dollars annually and are a major contributor to the total weather-associated insurance losses for all of Australia 9 Seven per cent of all major Australian disasters since 1967 can be directly attributed to east coast cyclones 9 Australian east coast lows often intensify rapidly overnight making them one of the more dangerous weather systems to affect the New South Wales coast 6 Pattern edit The incidence of these types of storms can be seen to fluctuate quite widely from one year to the next with none in some years and the highest incidence being twelve in 1978 79 7 Another feature of east coast low development is the tendency for clustering of events when conditions remain favourable For example near Brisbane almost one third of events occur within 20 days of a preceding event 7 Correlations of east coast cyclones with the interannual differences of the Southern Oscillation Index SOI indicate a strong preference for these storms to form just after a large swing from negative to positive Southern Oscillation index values and especially between swings from negative SOI the year before and positive SOI the year after This suggests a preference for formation of east coast cyclones between extreme events of the Southern Oscillation Index 9 Examples edit 5 6 June 2016 10 An east coast low combined with a King tide brought severe coastal damage notably to Collaroy and Coogee New South Wales along with flooding along the east coast and later severe flooding to Tasmania 11 Suomi NPP satellite image of east coast low 21 April 2015 2015

April 1 May 15 On 28 April the Bureau of Meteorology reported that an east coast low was forming off the coast of Fraser Island Record breaking rainfall and strong winds were recorded in southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales causing 5 fatalities in the Caboolture area 16 20 23 April 17 At least 4 people died in an event that was described as the worst since 2007 Severe flooding affected the areas of Maitland and Dungog inundating homes and isolating entire communities Power and water access was restricted for tens of thousands of homes across the wider Hunter Region 18 19 14 October 2014 New South Wales saw wind gusts up to 161 km h 100 mph 20 A Bureau of Meteorology spokesman described the rainfall observed at Marrickville Canterbury and Sydney Airport as probably what you d expect to see in one location about once every 20 years with rainfall totals in Strathfield at 94 mm 4 in falling in just three hours described as a one in 100 years recurrence Sydney Airport saw disruption to flights as the airport closed for a time due to high winds In Port Botany the strong winds caused the Hapag-Lloyd cargo ship Kiel Express to break free Waves off Sydney over 8 m 26 ft were reported 21 30,000 homes in the region were left without power 22 June 2013 23 24 21 May 2009 an east coast low caused massive coastal erosion and major flooding of the Clarence River 25 Pasha

of rain over four days 29 30 31 August 1996 cost at least two lives and caused almost A 20 million in damage Heavy rain and strong to gale force winds with extreme gusts of 64 kn 119 km h 74 mph at Wollongong and 53 kn 98 km h 61 mph near Sydney Airport 1 September 1995 A 8 million damage 1 August 1990 two lows in early August cause A 12 million damage 1 5 August 1986 24-hour rainfall totals
