Snow roller A snow roller in Cincinnati Ohio USA A snow roller is a rare meteorological phenomenon in which large snowballs are formed naturally as chunks of snow are blown along the ground by wind picking up material along the way in much the same way that the large snowballs used in snowmen are made They can be as small as a tennis ball but they can also be bigger than a car 1 Unlike snowballs made by people snow rollers are typically cylindrical in shape and are often hollow since the inner layers which are the first layers to form are weak and thin compared to the outer layers and can easily be blown away leaving what looks like a doughnut or Swiss roll The following conditions are needed for snow rollers to form There must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet loose snow with a temperature near the melting point of ice Under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick such as ice or powder snow The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers but not strong enough to blow them apart Alternatively gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill Because of this last condition snow rollers are more common in hilly areas 2 However the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon The term Snow Roller also applies to a horse-drawn implement used in the mid to late 19th century though tractor-drawn examples are still in limited use today mainly at ski resorts to pack snow It was mainly used in areas with high snow accumulation for access for horses and horse-drawn sleighs or wagons equipped with skis or runners The implement was essentially a large very wide wooden wheel weighed down with stone or concrete 3 Gallery edit Snow roller in Krkono e in Czech Republic near Poland On January 27 2014 these snow rollers were formed overnight during high winds in the community of Venus in western Pennsylvania Snow Roller in Rocky Mountain National Park Notice the gear type formations in this snow roller Rocky Mountain National Park Colorado Snow roller can also refer to a kind of equipment to plow down smaller quantities of snow this snow roller is on exhibit at the Cole Land Transportation Museum in Bangor Maine edit edit Snow rollers in Columbus Ohio Snow rollers in Estonia Snow rollers in Toronto Snow rollers in Kansas Snow rollers in central Illinois Feb 2003 Snow rollers in central Illinois Feb 2014 Snow rollers in Cincinnati Snow rollers in Utah Gilmore Susan 2007-03-17 A rare treat from nature Perfect snow doughnuts The Seattle Times Retrieved 2007-03-19 Snow Doughnuts Are The Real Thing National Public Radio 2007-03-19 Rare self-rolling giant snow balls found in UK The Telegraph January 8 2010 Marketplaceorg by Marc Sollinger - Friday February 14 2014 - 10 34 Collections of Waterford Historical Society - Horse-drawn snow roller Scenes From the History of Snow Removal - Horse-drawn snow roller
