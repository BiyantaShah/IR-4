Greek language For the Greek language used during particular eras see Proto-Greek Mycenaean Greek Ancient Greek Koine Greek Medieval Greek and Modern Greek Greek Modern Greek elini ka ellinik Greek elini ci losa listen ellinik gl ssa Greek language is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages native to Greece and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language spanning 34 centuries of written records 3 Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history other systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary were used previously 4 The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin Cyrillic Armenian Coptic Gothic and many other writing systems The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science especially astronomy mathematics and logic and Western philosophy such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle are composed the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin Greek Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics During antiquity Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek 5 In its modern form the Greek language is the official language in two countries Greece and Cyprus a recognised minority language in seven other countries and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece Cyprus Italy Albania Turkey and the Greek diaspora Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary Idealised portrayal of Homer History edit Main article History of Greek Greek has been spoken in the Balkan peninsula since around the 3rd millennium BC 6 or possibly earlier 7 The earliest written evidence is a Linear B clay tablet found in Messenia that dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC 8 making Greek the world s oldest recorded living language Among the Indo-European languages its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now extinct Anatolian languages Periods edit Proto-Greek-speaking area according to linguist Vladimir I Georgiev The Greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods Proto-Greek the unrecorded but assumed last ancestor of all known varieties of Greek The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the Greek peninsula sometime in the Neolithic era or the Bronze Age 9 Mycenaean Greek the language of the Mycenaean civilisation It is recorded in the Linear B script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards Ancient Greek in its various dialects the language of the Archaic and Classical periods of the ancient Greek civilisation It was widely known throughout the Roman Empire Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the Middle Ages but remained officially in use in the Byzantine world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the Fall of Constantinople and Greek migration to western Europe Koine Greek The fusion of Ionian with Attic the dialect of Athens began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect which became a lingua franca across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of Alexander the Great and after the Hellenistic colonisation of the known world it was spoken from Egypt to the fringes of India After the Roman conquest of Greece an unofficial bilingualism of Greek and Latin was established in the city of Rome and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the Roman Empire The origin of Christianity can also be traced through Koine Greek because the Apostles used this form of the language to spread Christianity It is also known as Hellenistic Greek New Testament Greek and sometimes Biblical Greek because it was the original language of the New Testament and the Old Testament was translated into the same language via the Septuagint Distribution of varieties of Greek in Anatolia 1910 Demotic in yellow Pontic in orange Cappadocian Greek in green with green dots indicating individual Cappadocian Greek villages 10 Medieval Greek also known as Byzantine Greek the continuation of Koine Greek up to the demise of the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century Medieval Greek is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching Modern Greek in many respects to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine Modern Greek Neo-Hellenic 11 Stemming from Medieval Greek Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period as early as the 11th century It is the language used by the modern Greeks and apart from Standard Modern Greek there are several dialects of it Diglossia edit Main article Greek language question In the modern era the Greek language entered a state of diglossia the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language What came to be known as the Greek language question was a polarization between two competing varieties of Modern Greek Dimotiki the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper and Katharevousa meaning purified a compromise between Dimotiki and Ancient Greek which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state In 1976 Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to Standard Modern Greek which is used today for all official purposes and in education 12 Historical unity edit The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas The historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasised Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages never since classical antiquity has its cultural literary and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language 13 It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages According to one estimation Homeric Greek is probably closer to demotic than 12-century Middle English is to modern spoken English 14 Geographic distribution edit Further information Greeks and Greek diaspora Greek language road sign A27 Motorway Greece Spread of Greek in the United States Greek is spoken by about 13 million people mainly in Greece Albania and Cyprus but also worldwide by the large Greek diaspora There are traditional Greek-speaking settlements and regions in the neighbouring countries of Albania Bulgaria and Turkey as well as in several countries in the Black Sea area such as Ukraine Russia Romania Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan and around the Mediterranean Sea Southern Italy Syria Israel Egypt Lebanon Libya and ancient coastal towns along the Levant The language is also spoken by Greek emigrant communities in many countries in Western Europe especially the United Kingdom and Germany Canada the United States Australia Argentina Brazil Chile South Africa and others Official status edit Greek is the official language of Greece where it is spoken by almost the entire population 15 It is also the official language of Cyprus nominally alongside Turkish 16 Because of the membership of Greece and Cyprus in the European Union Greek is one of the organization s 24 official languages 17 Furthermore Greek is officially recognised as a minority language in parts of Italy and official in Dropull and Himara Albania and as a minority language all over Albania 18 as well as in Lebanon Syria Armenia Romania and Ukraine as a regional or minority language in the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages 19 Greeks are also a recognised ethnic minority in Hungary Characteristics edit See also Ancient Greek grammar Koine Greek grammar and Modern Greek grammar The phonology morphology syntax and vocabulary of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period The division into conventional periods is as with all such periodisations relatively arbitrary especially because at all periods Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige and the literate borrowed heavily from it Phonology edit See also Modern Greek phonology Across its history the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little Greek shows a mixed syllable structure permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period see Koine Greek phonology for details replacement of the pitch accent with a stress accent simplification of the system of vowels and diphthongs loss of vowel length distinction monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a chain shift of vowels towards i iotacism development of the voiceless aspirated plosives p and t to the voiceless fricatives f and respectively the similar development of k to x may have taken place later the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography and both earlier and later phonemes are written with and development of the voiced plosives b d and to their voiced fricative counterparts later v and Morphology edit In all its stages the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes a limited but productive system of compounding 20 and a rich inflectional system Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time morphological changes are present throughout particularly in the nominal and verbal systems The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case its functions being largely taken over by the genitive The verbal system has lost the infinitive the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood Many have been replaced by periphrastic analytical forms Nouns and adjectives edit Pronouns show distinctions in person 1st 2nd and 3rd number singular dual and plural in the ancient language singular and plural alone in later stages and gender masculine feminine and neuter and decline for case from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language 21 Nouns articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun Verbs edit The inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language s history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression Greek verbs have synthetic inflectional forms for Syntax edit Many aspects of the syntax of Greek have remained constant verbs agree with their subject only the use of the surviving cases is largely intact nominative for subjects and predicates accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions genitive for possessors articles precede nouns adpositions are largely prepositional relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial However the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the modern form of the language Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions and uses participles more restrictively The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO Vocabulary edit Greek is a language distinguished by an extensive vocabulary Most of the vocabulary of Ancient Greek was inherited but it includes a number of borrowings from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks 23 Words of non-Indo-European origin can be traced into Greek from as early as Mycenaean times they include a large number of Greek toponyms The vast majority of Modern Greek vocabulary is directly inherited from Ancient Greek but in some cases words have changed meanings Loanwords words of foreign origin have entered the language mainly from Latin Venetian and Turkish During the older periods of Greek loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections thus leaving only a foreign root word Modern borrowings from the 20th century on especially from French and English are typically not inflected Greek loanwords in other languages edit For more details on this topic see Greek and Latin roots in English Greek words have been widely borrowed into other languages including English mathematics physics astronomy democracy philosophy athletics theatre rhetoric baptism evangelist etc Moreover Greek words and word elements continue to be productive as a basis for coinages anthropology photography telephony isomer biomechanics cinematography etc and form with Latin words the foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary like all words ending with logy discourse There are many English words of Greek origin 24 Classification edit Greek is an independent branch of the Indo-European language family The ancient language most closely related to it may be ancient Macedonian 25 which many scholars suggest may have been a dialect of Greek itself but it is so poorly attested that it is difficult to conclude anything about it 26 Independently of the Macedonian question some scholars have grouped Greek into Graeco-Phrygian as Greek and the extinct Phrygian share features that are not found in other Indo-European languages 27 Among living languages some Indo-Europeanists suggest that Greek may be most closely related to Armenian see Graeco-Armenian or the Indo-Iranian languages see Graeco-Aryan but little definitive evidence has been found for grouping the living branches of the family 28 In addition Albanian has also been considered somewhat related to Greek and Armenian by some linguists If proven and recognised the three languages would form a new Balkan sub-branch with other dead European languages 29 Writing system edit See also Greek Braille Linear B edit Main article Linear B Linear B attested as early as the late 15th century BC was the first script used to write Greek 30 It is basically a syllabary which was finally deciphered by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick in the 1950s its precursor Linear A has not been deciphered to this day 30 The language of the Linear B texts Mycenaean Greek is the earliest known form of Greek 30 Cypriot syllabary edit Main article Cypriot syllabary Greek inscription in Cypriot syllabic script Another similar system used to write the Greek language was the Cypriot syllabary also a descendant of Linear A via the intermediate Cypro-Minoan syllabary which is closely related to Linear B but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences The Cypriot syllabary is attested in Cyprus from the 11th century BC until its gradual abandonment in the late Classical period in favor of the standard Greek alphabet 31 Greek alphabet edit Main articles Greek alphabet and Greek orthography Ancient epichoric variants of the Greek alphabet from Euboea Ionia Athens and Corinth comparing to modern Greek Greek has been written in the Greek alphabet since approximately the 9th century BC It was created by modifying the Phoenician alphabet with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the vowels The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late Ionic variant introduced for writing classical Attic in 403 BC In classical Greek as in classical Latin only upper-case letters existed The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster more convenient cursive writing style with the use of ink and quill The Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters each with an uppercase majuscule and lowercase minuscule form The letter sigma has an additional lowercase form used in the final position Diacritics edit Main article Greek diacritics In addition to the letters the Greek alphabet features a number of diacritical signs three different accent marks acute grave and circumflex originally denoting different shapes of pitch accent on the stressed vowel the so-called breathing marks rough and smooth breathing originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial h and the diaeresis used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period Actual usage of the grave in handwriting saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century and it has only been retained in typography After the writing reform of 1982 most diacritics are no longer used Since then Greek has been written mostly in the simplified monotonic orthography or monotonic system which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis The traditional system now called the polytonic orthography or polytonic system is still used internationally for the writing of Ancient Greek Punctuation edit In Greek the question mark is written as the English semicolon while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point known as the ano teleia In Greek the comma also functions as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words principally distinguishing ti whatever from ti that 32 Ancient Greek texts often used scriptio continua continuous writing which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries 33 Latin alphabet edit Greek has occasionally been written in the Latin script especially in areas under Venetian rule or by Greek Catholics The term Frankolevantinika applies when the Latin script is used to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism because Frankos is an older Greek term for Roman Catholic Frankochiotika meaning Catholic Chiot alludes to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of Chios Additionally the term Greeklish is often used when the Greek language is written in a Latin script in online communications 34 See also edit Greece portal Language portal Modern Greek Varieties of
