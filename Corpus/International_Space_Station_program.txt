International Space Station program The International Space Station program is tied together by a complex set of legal political and financial agreements between the fifteen nations involved in the project governing ownership of the various components rights to crewing and utilization and responsibilities for crew rotation and station resupply These agreements tie together the five space agencies and their respective International Space Station Programs and govern how they interact with each other on a daily basis to maintain station operations from traffic control of spacecraft to and from the station to utilization of space and crew time In spring 2010 the International Space Station Program Managers from each of the five partner agencies were presented with Aviation Week s Laureate Award in the Space category 1 and NASA s International Space Station Program was awarded the 2009 Collier Trophy Legal aspects edit 1998 Agreement edit The legal structure that regulates the station is multi-layered The primary layer establishing obligations and rights between the ISS partners is the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement IGA an international treaty signed on January 28 1998 by fifteen governments involved in the Space Station project The ISS consists of Canada Japan the Russian Federation the United States and eleven Member States of the European Space Agency Belgium Denmark France Germany Italy The Netherlands Norway Spain Sweden Switzerland and the United Kingdom Article 1 outlines its purpose This Agreement is a long term international co-operative framework on the basis of genuine partnership for the detailed design development operation and utilization of a permanently inhabited civil Space Station for peaceful purposes in accordance with international law 2 The IGA sets the stage for a second layer of agreements between the partners referred to as Memoranda of Understanding MOUs of which four exist between NASA and each of the four other partners There are no MOUs between ESA Roskosmos CSA and JAXA because NASA is the designated manager of the ISS The MOUs are used to describe the roles and responsibilities of the partners in more detail A third layer consists of bartered contractual agreements or the trading of the partners rights and duties including the 2005 commercial framework agreement between NASA and Roskosmos that sets forth the terms and conditions under which NASA purchases seats on Soyuz crew transporters and cargo capacity on unmanned Progress transporters A fourth legal layer of agreements implements and supplements the four MOUs further Notably among them is the ISS code of conduct setting out criminal jurisdiction anti-harassment and certain other behavior rules for ISS crewmembers 3 made in 1998 Utilization edit There is no fixed percentage of ownership for the whole space station Rather Article 5 of the IGA sets forth that each partner shall retain jurisdiction and control over the elements it registers and over personnel in or on the Space Station who are its nationals 2 Therefore for each ISS module only one partner retains sole ownership Still the agreements to use the space station facilities are more complex The station is composed of two sides Russian Orbital Segment ROS and US Orbital Segment USOS 4 Russian Orbital Segment mostly Russian ownership except the Zarya module Zarya first component of the Space Station USSR Russia-built US funded hence US-owned Zvezda the functional center of the Russian portion living quarters Russia-owned Pirs airlock docking Russia-owned Poisk redundancy for Pirs Russia-owned Rassvet storage docking Russia-owned Allocation of the US side of ISS hardware between nations US Orbital Segment mixed US and international ownership Columbus

Station expeditions Long-duration flights to the International Space Station are broken into expeditions Expeditions have an average duration of half a year and they commence following the official handover of the station from one Expedition commander to another Expeditions 1 through 6 consisted of three-person crews but the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster led to a reduction to two crew members for Expeditions 7 to 12 Expedition 13 saw the restoration of the station crew to three While only three crew members are permanently on the station several expeditions such as Expedition 16 have consisted of up to six astronauts or cosmonauts Only 3 members were active at any given time one of the seats was rotated out during separate flights 8 9 STS-115 expanded of the living volume and capabilities of the station so that it could host a crew of six Expedition 20 was the first ISS crew of this size Expedition 20 s crew was lifted to the station in two separate Soyuz-TMA flights launched at two different times each Soyuz-TMA can hold only three people Soyuz TMA-14 on 26 March 2009 and Soyuz TMA-15 on 27 May 2009 However the station would not be permanently occupied by six crew members all year For example when the Expedition 20 crew Roman Romanenko Frank De Winne and Bob Thirsk returned to Earth in November 2009 for a period of about two weeks only two crew members Jeff Williams and Max Surayev were aboard This increased to five in early December when Oleg Kotov Timothy Creamer and Soichi Noguchi arrived on Soyuz TMA-17 It decreased to three when Williams and Surayev departed in March 2010 and finally returned to six in April 2010 with the arrival of Soyuz TMA-18 carrying Aleksandr Skvortsov Mikhail Korniyenko and Tracy Caldwell Dyson 8 9 The International Space Station is the most-visited spacecraft in the history of space flight As of 9 October 2015 update The ISS has had 220 visitors Mir had 137 visitors 104 different people 10 Visiting spacecraft edit See also List of human spaceflights to the ISS and List of unmanned spaceflights to the ISS The Space Shuttle Endeavour approaching the ISS during STS-118 Spacecraft from four different space agencies visit the ISS serving a variety of purposes The Automated Transfer Vehicle from the European Space Agency the Russian Roskosmos Progress spacecraft and the H-II Transfer Vehicle from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency have provided resupply services to the station In addition Russia supplies a Soyuz spacecraft used for crew rotation and emergency evacuation which is replaced every six months Finally the US serviced the ISS through its Space Shuttle program providing resupply missions assembly and logistics flights and crew rotation until the program was retired in 2011 SpaceX was the first private company to resupply the ISS 11 in October 8 2012 The availability of docking ports on the station and traffic from four different agencies and launch sites must be coordinated Spacecraft launches can see delays while waiting for traffic to clear 12 A particular tight traffic jam occurred during the latch of ESA s Jules Verne Automated Transfer Vehicle in spring 2008 The cargo ship launched 2 day prior to STS-123 and had to wait in a holding orbit performing system tests while waiting for the shuttle to clear the station 13 As of 13 April 2016 update there have been 46 Soyuz 63 Progress 5 ATV 5 HTV 5 Cygnus 7 Dragon and 37 Space Shuttle flights to the station 14 Expeditions require on average 2,722 kg of supplies Soyuz crew rotation flights and Progress resupply flights visit the station on average two and three times respectively each year 15 As of 13 April 2016 update there were six spacecraft docked for the first time with the ISS Mission control centers edit See also Mission Control Center Space centers involved with the ISS programme The components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at control centers across the globe including NASA s Mission Control Center at Lyndon B Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas serves as the primary control facility for the US segment of the ISS and also controls the Space Shuttle missions that visit the station 16 NASA s Payload Operations and Integration Center at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama serves as the center that coordinates all payload operations in the US Segment 16 This center links Earth-bound researchers around the world with their experiments and astronauts aboard the International Space Station 17 Roskosmos s Mission Control Center at Korolyov Moscow controls the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS in addition to individual Soyuz and Progress missions 16 ESA s Columbus Control Center at the German Aerospace Center DLR in

all flights of the unmanned Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle respectively 16 CSA s MSS Control at Saint-Hubert Quebec Canada controls and monitors the Mobile Servicing System or Canadarm2 16 Commercial Orbital Transportation Services edit Main article Commercial Orbital Transportation Services On January 18 2006 NASA announced Commercial Orbital Transportation Services programme 18 NASA has suggested that Commercial services to ISS will be necessary through at least 2015 19 Instead of flying payloads to ISS on government-operated vehicles NASA would spend 500 million less than the cost of a single Space Shuttle flight through 2010 to finance the demonstration of orbital transportation services from commercial providers COTS must be distinguished from the related Commercial Resupply Services CRS program COTS relates to the development of the vehicles CRS to the actual deliveries COTS involves a number of Space Act Agreements with NASA providing milestone-based payments On December 23 2008 NASA entered into CRS contracts with Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to utilize their COTS cargo vehicles Cygnus and Dragon respectively for cargo delivery to the International Space Station Constellation Program edit Main article Constellation Program Constellation Program a human spaceflight program was developed by NASA On February 1 2010 President Barack Obama announced a proposal to cancel the program effective with the US 2011 fiscal year budget 20 21 22 23 but later announced changes to the proposal in a major space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center on April 15 2010 which including reviving the Orion capsule for use as a rescue spacecraft for ISS Future of the ISS edit The heads of the ISS agencies from Canada Europe Japan Russia and the United States meet in Tokyo to review ISS cooperation Former NASA Administrator Michael D Griffin says the International Space Station has a role to play as NASA moves forward with a new focus for the manned space programme which is to go out beyond Earth orbit for purposes of human exploration and scientific discovery The International Space Station is now a stepping stone on the way rather than being the end of the line Griffin said 24 Griffin has said that station crews will not only continue to learn how to live and work in space but also will learn how to build hardware that can survive and function for the years required to make the round-trip voyage from Earth to Mars 24 Despite this view however in an internal e-mail leaked to the press on 18 August 2008 from Griffin to NASA managers 25 26 27 Griffin apparently communicated his belief that the current US administration had made no viable plan for US crews to participate in the ISS beyond 2011 and that the Office of Management and Budget OMB and Office of Science and Technology Policy OSTP were actually seeking its demise 26 The e-mail appeared to suggest that Griffin believed the only reasonable solution was to extend the operation of the space shuttle beyond 2010 but noted that Executive Policy ie the White House was firm that there will be no extension of the space shuttle retirement date and thus no US capability to launch crews into orbit until the Ares I Orion system becomes operational in 2014 at the earliest 26 He did not see purchase of Russian launches for NASA crews as politically viable following the 2008 South Ossetia war and hoped the incoming Barack Obama administration would resolve the issue in 2009 by extending space shuttle operations beyond 2010 A solicitation issued by NASA JSC indicates NASA s intent to purchase from Roscosmos a minimum of 3 Soyuz seats up to a maximum of 24 seats beginning in the Spring of 2012 to provide ISS crew transportation 28 29 On 7 September 2008 NASA released a statement regarding the leaked email in which Griffin said The leaked internal email fails to provide the contextual framework for my remarks and my support for the administration s policies Administration policy is to retire the shuttle in 2010 and purchase crew transport from Russia until Ares and Orion are available The administration continues to support our request for an INKSNA exemption Administration policy continues to be that we will take no action to preclude continued operation of the International Space Station past 2016 I strongly support these administration policies as do OSTP and OMB Michael D Griffin 30 On 15 October 2008 President Bush signed the NASA Authorization Act of 2008 giving NASA funding for one additional mission to deliver science experiments to the station 31 32 33 34 The Act allows for an additional space shuttle flight STS-134 to the ISS to install the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer which was previously cancelled 35 President Barack Obama has supported the continued operation of the station and supported the NASA Authorization Act of 2008 35 Obama s plan for space exploration includes finishing the station and completion of the Orion spacecraft programme 36 The operation of the ISS was prolonged until 2024 New partners edit China has reportedly expressed interest in the project especially if it would be able to work with the RKA However as of 2009 update China is not involved due to US objections concerning its human rights record and issues surrounding technology transfer 37 38 The heads of both the South Korean and Indian space agencies announced at the first plenary session of the 2009 International Astronautical Congress on 12 October that their nations intend to join the ISS program The talks begin in 2010 and were not successful The heads of agency also expressed support for extending ISS lifetime 39 European countries not a part of the International Space Station program will be allowed access to the station in a three-year trial period ESA officials say 40 Costs edit The most cited figure of an estimate of overall costs of the ISS ranges from 35 billion to 160 billion USD 41 ESA the only agency actually stating potential overall costs on its website estimates 100 billion 42 Giving a precise cost estimate for the ISS is not straightforward as it is difficult to determine which costs should actually be contributed to the ISS program or how the Russian contribution should be measured NASA edit NASA s current budget projections see an end to ISS funding in 2017 in order to free funds for the Vision for Space Exploration The overall majority of costs for NASA are incurred by flight operations and expenses for the overall management of the ISS Costs for initially building the US portion of the ISS modules and external structure on the ground and construction in space as well as crew and supply flights to the ISS do account for far less than the general operating costs see annual budget allocation below NASA does not include the basic Space Shuttle program costs in the expenses incurred for the ISS program despite the fact that the Space Shuttle has been nearly exclusively used for ISS construction and supply flights since December 1998 NASA s 2007 budget request lists costs for the ISS without Shuttle costs as 25.6 billion for the years 1994 to 2005 43 For each of 2005 and 2006 about 1.7 to 1.8 billion are allocated to the ISS program The annual expenses will increase until 2010 when they will reach 2.3 billion and should then stay at the same level however inflation-adjusted until 2016 the defined end of the program NASA has allocated between 300 and 500 million for program shutdown costs in 2017 2005 ISS budget allocation edit NASA allocates about 125 million US dollars USD annually to EVAs The 1.8 billion expensed in 2005 consisted of 44 Development of new hardware 70 million were allocated to core development for instance development of systems like navigation data support or environmental Spacecraft Operations 800 million consisting of 125 million for each of software extravehicular activity systems and logistics and maintenance An additional 150 million is spent on flight avionics and crew systems The rest of 250 million goes to overall ISS management Launch and Mission operations Although the Shuttle launch costs are not considered part of the ISS budget mission and mission integration 300 million medical support 25 million and Shuttle launch site processing 125 million is within the ISS budget Operations Program Integration 350 million was spent on maintaining and sustaining US flight and ground hardware and software to ensure integrity of the ISS design and the continuous safe operability ISS cargo crew 140 million was spent for purchase of supplies cargo and crew capability for Progress and Soyuz flights Shuttle costs as part of ISS costs edit The only non-ISS-related Shuttle flight between 2005 and 2011 was a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission on STS-125 Only costs for mission and mission integration and launch site processing for the 33 ISS-related Shuttle flights are included in NASA s ISS program costs Basic costs of the Shuttle program are as mentioned above not considered part of the overall ISS costs by NASA because the Shuttle program is considered an independent program aside from the ISS Since December 1998 the Shuttle has however been used nearly exclusively for ISS flights since the first ISS flight in December 1998 until October 2007 only 5 flights out of 28 flights have not been to the ISS and only the planned Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission in 2009 will not be ISS-related out of 13 planned missions until the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2010 Post-Shuttle ISS supply costs edit The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of Atlantis final flight on July 21 2011 NASA was reliant even at the time on some of the resupply contracts being fielded out to Soyuz and Progress and the other unmanned tugs but it had launched a few years earlier into a program of aggressive development of commercial US resupply vehicles At the beginning of 2014 both SpaceX s Dragon and Orbital s Cygnus vehicles have fulfilled commercial resupply contracts and NASA will be shifting to full-time reliance on these and possibly in the medium-term future SNC s Dream Chaser and the NASA-developed Orion capsule On January 8 2014 the White House announced that the ISS was having its funding extended from an outlook that ended in 2020 to at least 2024 An estimate was issued that it would cost 3B year for 2012-2024 a substantial share of NASA s then- 17B budget ESA edit Further information European contribution to the International Space Station ESA calculates that its contribution over the 15 year lifetime of the project will be 9 billion 45 Just the costs for the Columbus Laboratory tops more than 1.4 billion about 2.1 billion including the money spent on the ground control infrastructure known as Columbus Control Center to operate it The total development costs for ATV amount to approximately 1.35 billion 46 and considering that each Ariane 5 launch costs around 150 million each ATV launch will incur considerable costs as well The ISS has been far more expensive than originally anticipated The ESA estimates the overall cost from the start of the project in the early 1990s to the prospective end in 2017 to be in the region of 100 billion 157 billion or 65.3 billion 42 JAXA edit The development of the Japanese Experiment Module JAXA s main contribution to the ISS has cost about 325 billion yen about 2.8 billion 47 In the year 2005 JAXA allocated about 40 billion yen about 350 million USD to the ISS program 48 The annual running costs for Japanese Experiment Module will total around 350 to 400 million In addition JAXA has committed itself to develop and launch the H-II Transfer Vehicle for which development costs total nearly 1 billion In total over the 24 year lifespan of the ISS program JAXA will contribute well over 10 billion to the ISS program Roskosmos edit A considerable part of the Russian Space Agency s budget is used for the ISS Since 1998 there have been over two dozen Soyuz and Progress flights the primary crew and cargo transporters since 2003 The question of how much Russia spends on the station measured in USD is however not easy to answer The two modules currently in orbit are derivatives of the Mir program and therefore development costs are much lower than for other modules In addition the exchange rate between ruble and USD is not adequately giving a real comparison to what the costs for Russia really are citation needed CSA edit Canada whose three main contributions to the ISS are the Canadarm2 the mobile base system and Dextre the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator also known as the Canada Hand estimates that through the last 20 years it has contributed about C 1.4 billion to the ISS Canada has continued to be a vital member of ISS through the past ten years and continues to play a major role in the ISS 49 Criticism edit The International Space Station has been the target of varied criticism over the years Critics contend that the time and money spent on the ISS could be better spent on other projects whether they be robotic spacecraft missions space exploration investigations of problems here on Earth or just tax savings 50 Some critics like Robert L Park argue that very little scientific research was convincingly planned for the ISS in the first place 51 They also argue that the primary feature of a space-based laboratory is its microgravity environment which can usually be studied more cheaply with a vomit comet 52 One of the most ambitious ISS projects to date the Centrifuge Accommodations Module has been cancelled due to the prohibitive costs NASA faces in simply completing the ISS As a result the research done on the ISS is generally limited to experiments which do not require any specialized apparatus For example in the first half of 2007 ISS research dealt primarily with human biological responses to being in space covering topics like kidney stones circadian rhythm and the effects of cosmic rays on the nervous system 53 54 55 Other critics have attacked the ISS on some technical design grounds Jeff Foust argued that the ISS requires too much maintenance especially by risky expensive EVAs 56 The magazine The American Enterprise reports for instance that ISS astronauts now spend 85 percent of their time on construction and maintenance alone The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has mentioned that its orbit is rather highly inclined which makes Russian launches cheaper but US launches more expensive 57 This was intended as a design point to encourage Russian involvement with the ISS and Russian involvement saved the project from abandonment in the wake of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster but the choice may have increased the costs of completing the ISS substantially citation needed In response to some of these criticisms advocates of manned space exploration say that criticism of the ISS project is short-sighted and that manned space research and exploration have produced billions of dollars worth of tangible benefits to people on Earth Jerome Schnee estimated that the indirect economic return from spin-offs of human space exploration has been many times the initial public investment 58 A review of the claims by the Federation of American Scientists argued that NASA s rate of return from spin-offs is actually astoundingly bad except for aeronautics work that has led to aircraft sales 59 Critics also say that NASA is often casually credited with spin-offs such as Velcro and portable computers that were developed independently for other reasons 60 NASA maintains a list of spin-offs from the construction of the ISS as well as from work performed on the ISS 61 62 However NASA s official list is much narrower and more arcane than dramatic narratives of billions of dollars of spin-offs citation needed It is therefore debatable whether the ISS as distinct from the wider space program will be a major contributor to society Some advocates argue that apart from its scientific value it is an important example of international cooperation 63 Others claim that the ISS is an asset that if properly leveraged could allow more economical manned Lunar and Mars missions 64 Either way advocates who argue that it misses the point to expect a hard financial return from the ISS rather it is intended as part of a general expansion of spaceflight capabilities citation needed End of Mission edit In 2009 NASA had stated plans to end the ISS programme and deorbit the ISS in early 2016 65 This was in accordance with the then-President Bush s policy President Obama announced new policy in 2010 extending the program through 2020 66 All five ISS-participating space agencies had indicated in 2010 their desire to see the platform continue flying beyond 2015 but Europe struggled to agree on funding arrangements within its member states until agreement was reached in March 2011 67 68 69 Russia and ISS partners in a 2011 statement said that work is being done to make sure other modules can be used beyond 2015 The first Russian module was launched in 1998 and the 30th anniversary of that module s launch has been chosen as a target date for certification of all components of the ISS 67 According to a 2009 report RKK Energia is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the Russian Orbital Segment when the end of mission is reached and use them as a basis for a new station known as the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex OPSEK The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS include the Multipurpose Laboratory Module MLM currently scheduled to be launched mid-2018 along with other Russian modules which are currently planned to be attached to the MLM Neither the MLM nor any additional modules attached to it would have reached the end of their useful lives by 2020 The report presents a statement from an unnamed Russian engineer who believes that based on the experience from Mir a thirty-year life should be possible except for micrometeorite damage because the Russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind 70 According to the Outer Space Treaty the United States is legally responsible for all modules it has launched 71 In ISS planning NASA examined options including returning the station to Earth via shuttle missions deemed too expensive as the station USOS is not designed for disassembly and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions 72 natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to Skylab boosting the station to a higher altitude which would simply delay reentry and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area 73 The technical feasibility of a controlled targeted deorbit into a remote ocean was found to be possible only with Russia s assistance 73 At the time ISS was launched the Russian Space Agency had experience from de-orbiting the Salyut 4 5 6 and 7 space stations while NASA s first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory would not occur for another two years 74 NASA currently has no spacecraft capable of de-orbiting the ISS at the time of decommissioning 75 Skylab the only space station built and launched entirely by the US decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years and no attempt was made to de-orbit the station using a deorbital burn Remains of Skylab hit populated areas of Esperance Western Australia 76 without injuries or loss of life While the entire USOS cannot be reused and will be discarded some Russian modules will be reused Nauka the Node module two science power platforms and Rassvet launched between 2010 and 2015 and joined to the ROS will be separated to form the next Russian space station OPSEK 77 edit edit ESA - Columbus JAXA - Space Environment Utilization and Space Experiment NASA - Station Science RSC Energia -
