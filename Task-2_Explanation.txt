Steps followed by my indexer:

1. Reads the inverted indexer from a file created in HW-3 Task-2
2. Reads the document length for all documents from file created in HW-3 Task-2
3. Reads all queries to be queried on corpus from file called "./QueryList.txt"
4. Now for each query the indexer will calculate score for each document per query term in the query.
5. After summing all the scores for documents for each query term for given query, it will sort based
    on score calculated using BM25.
6. Finally will write those top 100 documents with the specified format into a txt file storing it
    in folder "./Task-2".
